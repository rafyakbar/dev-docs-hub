# Toast

A message that provides feedback to users about an action or event, often temporary and dismissible.

To use the Toast component from Livewire, you must include it somewhere on the page; often in your layout file:



Copy to clipboard

```
<body>    <!-- ... -->    <flux:toast /></body>
```

If you are using wire:navigate to navigate between pages, you may want to persist the toast component so that toast messages don't suddenly disappear when navigating away from the page.



Copy to clipboard

```
<body>    <!-- ... -->    @persist('toast')        <flux:toast />    @endpersist</body>
```

Once the toast component is present on the page, you can use the Flux::toast() method to trigger a toast message from your Livewire components:





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpnamespace App\Livewire;use Livewire\Component;use Flux\Flux;class EditPost extends Component{    public function save()    {        // ...        Flux::toast('Your changes have been saved.');    }}
```

You can also trigger a toast from Alpine directly using Flux's magic methods:



Copy to clipboard

```
<button x-on:click="$flux.toast('Your changes have been saved.')">    Save changes</button>
```

Or you can use the window.Flux global object to trigger a toast from any JavaScript in your application:



Copy to clipboard

Both $flux and window.Flux support the following method parameter signatures:



Copy to clipboard

```
Flux.toast('Your changes have been saved.')// Or...Flux.toast({    heading: 'Changes saved',    text: 'Your changes have been saved.',    variant: 'success',})
```



## [With heading](#with-heading)

Use a heading to provide additional context for the toast.





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
Flux::toast(    heading: 'Changes saved.',    text: 'You can always update this in your settings.',);
```



## [Variants](#variants)

Use the variant prop to change the visual style of the toast.





Success

Warning

Danger





Copy to clipboard

```
Flux::toast(variant: 'success', ...);Flux::toast(variant: 'warning', ...);Flux::toast(variant: 'danger', ...);
```



## [Positioning](#positioning)

By default, the toast will appear in the bottom right corner of the page. You can customize this position using the position prop.





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:toast position="top end" /><!-- Customize top padding for things like navbars... --><flux:toast position="top end" class="pt-24" />
```



## [Duration](#duration)

By default, the toast will automatically dismiss after 5 seconds. You can customize this duration by passing a number of milliseconds to the duration prop.





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
// 1 second...Flux::toast(duration: 1000, ...);
```



## [Permanent](#permanent)

Use a value of 0 as the duration prop to make the toast stay open indefinitely.





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
// Show indefinitely...Flux::toast(duration: 0, ...);
```



## [Stack](#stack)

To show a stack of toasts, you can wrap the flux:toast component in a flux:toast.group component. By default, toasts in a stack overlap and expand on hover to show each toast vertically.





Save changes





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:toast.group>    <flux:toast /></flux:toast.group>
```

Use the expanded prop to always show the toast stack in an expanded state, making all toasts visible at once.



Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:toast.group expanded>    <flux:toast /></flux:toast.group>
```

The group component also accepts the position prop to control where the toast stack appears on the screen.



Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:toast.group position="top end">    <flux:toast /></flux:toast.group>
```
