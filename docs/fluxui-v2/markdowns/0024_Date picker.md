# Date picker

Allow users to select dates or date ranges via a calendar overlay. Perfect for filtering data or scheduling events.

Use date inputs instead of date pickers for far-future or past events such as birthdates.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker />
```



## Basic usage

Set the initial selected date using the value prop with a Y-m-d formatted date string:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker value="2026-03-03" />
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker wire:model="date" />
```

Now you can access the selected date from your Livewire component using either a Carbon instance or a Y-m-d formatted string:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Illuminate\Support\Carbon;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;class CreatePost extends Component {    public ?Carbon $date;    public function save()    {        Post::create([            // ...            'published_at' => $this->date,        ])        // ...    }}
```



## [Input trigger](#input-trigger)

Attach the date picker to a date input for more precise date selection control.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker wire:model="date">    <x-slot name="trigger">        <flux:date-picker.input />    </x-slot></flux:date-picker>
```



## [Range picker](#range-picker)

Enable selection of date ranges for reporting, booking systems, or any scenario requiring a start and end date.





Cancel

Select range





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" />
```

Set the initial range using the value prop with a start and end date separated by a forward slash:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" value="2026-03-02/2026-03-06" />
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" wire:model="range" />
```

Now you can access the selected range from your Livewire component using an associative array of Y-m-d formatted date strings:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Illuminate\Support\Carbon;use Livewire\Component;class Dashboard extends Component {    public array $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = [            'start' => now()->subMonth()->format('Y-m-d'),            'end' => now()->format('Y-m-d'),        ];    }}
```

Alternatively, you can use the specialized DateRange object for enhanced functionality:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = new DateRange(now()->subMonth(), now());    }}
```

We highly recommend using the DateRange object for range selection, it provides a lot of useful functionality.

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" min-range="3" />
```





Cancel

Select range





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" max-range="10" />
```



## [Range with inputs](#range-with-inputs)

Use separate inputs for start and end dates to provide a clearer interface for date range selection.





Start

End

Cancel

Select range





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range">    <x-slot name="trigger">        <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-6 sm:gap-4">            <flux:date-picker.input label="Start" />            <flux:date-picker.input label="End" />        </div>    </x-slot></flux:date-picker>
```



## [Presets](#presets)

You can also specify which presets to show, and in which order, using the presets prop:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker    mode="range"    presets="today yesterday thisWeek last7Days thisMonth yearToDate allTime"/>
```

| nextQuarter | Next Quarter | DateRange::nextQuarter() | Next quarter |
| nextYear | Next Year | DateRange::nextYear() | Next year |
| next14Days | Next 14 Days | DateRange::next14Days() | Next 14 days from today |
| next30Days | Next 30 Days | DateRange::next30Days() | Next 30 days from today |
| next3Months | Next 3 Months | DateRange::next3Months() | Next 3 months from today |

| allTime | All Time | DateRange::allTime($start) | Minimum supplied date to today |
| custom | Custom Range | DateRange::custom() | User-defined date range |



## All time

When using the allTime preset, you must specify a minimum date using the min prop. This minimum date will be used as the start date of the "All Time" range. Today's date will be used as the end date:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker    mode="range"    presets="... allTime"    :min="auth()->user()->created_at->format('Y-m-d')"/>
```

If you need to construct this via the DateRange object from Livewire, you can do so like this:

Copy to clipboard

```
use Flux\DateRange;$this->range = DateRange::allTime(start: auth()->user()->created_at);
```

If you are using this date range to filter data, you may want to remove "where" constraints from the query when allTime is selected:

Copy to clipboard

```
$orders = Order::when($this->range->isNotAllTime(), function ($query) => {    $query->whereBetween('created_at', $this->range);})->get();
```



## Custom range preset

When a user selects a custom date range that doesn't match any other preset, the picker will automatically switch to the custom preset if it is included in the presets prop.

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker mode="range" presets="... custom" />
```



## [Unavailable dates](#unavailable-dates)

Disable specific dates from being selected. Useful for blocking out holidays, showing booked dates, or indicating unavailable time slots.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker unavailable="2026-03-02,2026-03-04" />
```



## [With today shortcut](#with-today-shortcut)

Add a shortcut button to quickly navigate to today's date. When viewing a different month, it jumps to the current month. When already viewing the current month, it selects today's date.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker with-today />
```



## [Selectable header](#selectable-header)

Enable quick navigation by making the month and year in the header selectable.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker selectable-header />
```



## [Fixed weeks](#fixed-weeks)

Display a consistent number of weeks in every month. Prevents layout shifts when navigating between months with different numbers of weeks.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker fixed-weeks />
```



## [Start day](#start-day)

By deafult the first day of the week will be automatically set based on the user's locale. You can override this by setting the start-day attribute to any day of the week.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker start-day="1" />
```



## [Open to](#open-to)

Set the date that the date picker will open to, if there is no selected date.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker open-to="2027-04-01" />
```

If you want the date picker to always use the open-to date, you can add the force-open-to attribute.







Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker open-to="2027-04-01" force-open-to />
```



## [Week numbers](#week-numbers)

Display the week number for each week.





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker week-numbers />
```



## [Localization](#localization)

By default, the date picker will use the browser's locale (e.g. navigator.language).

You can override this behavior by setting the locale attribute to any valid locale string (e.g. fr for French, en-US for English, etc.):





Cancel

Select date





Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:date-picker locale="ja-JP" />
```



## The DateRange object

Flux provides a specialized Flux\DateRange object that extends the native CarbonPeriod class. This object provides a number of convenience methods to easily create and manage date ranges.

First, it's worth noting that most of the time, you will want to use wire:model.live to bind the range property to a DateRange object. This will automatically update the range property whenever the user selects a date range:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar wire:model.live="range" />
```

Now, in your component, you can type hint the range property as a DateRange object:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;}
```



## Instantiation

You can initialize a DateRange object by passing a start and end date to the DateRange constructor from something like the mount method:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = new DateRange(now(), now()->addDays(7));    }}
```



## Persisting to the session

You can persist a DateRange object in the user's session by using the #[Session] attribute:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Session;use Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    #[Session]    public DateRange $range;}
```



## Using with Eloquent

You can use the DateRange object with Eloquent's whereBetween() method to filter queries by date range:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Order;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public ?DateRange $range;    #[Computed]    public function orders() {        return $this->range            ? Order::whereBetween('created_at', $this->range)->get()            : Order::all();    }}
```



## Available methods

The DateRange object extends the native CarbonPeriod class, so it inherits all of its methods. Here are a few examples:

Copy to clipboard

```
$range = new Flux\DateRange(    now()->subDays(1),    now()->addDays(1),);// Get the start and end dates as Carbon instances...$start = $range->start();$end = $range->end();// Check if the range contains a date...$range->contains(now());// Get the number of days in the range...$range->length();// Loop over the range by day...foreach ($range as $date) {    // $date is a Carbon instance...}// Get the range as an array of Carbon instances representing each day in the range...$range->toArray();
```

You can also use it anywhere Eloquent utilities expect a CarbonPeriod instance:

Copy to clipboard

```
$orders = Order::whereBetween('created_at', $range)->get();
```



## Range presets

When using the presets prop, the calendar will get/set an associative array of dates as well as a preset key:

Copy to clipboard

```
[    'start' => null,    'end' => null,    'preset' => 'lastMonth',]
```

You can directly get/set the preset string through a simple array binding:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;class Dashboard extends Component {    public array $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = [            'start' => null,            'end' => null,            'preset' => 'lastMonth',        ];    }}
```

However, the DateRange object is equipped to manage the preset internally.

For example, you can create a range using the lastMonth() method:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = DateRange::lastMonth();    }}
```

[View the complete list of available presets ->](#available-presets)

You can access the preset as an enum value via the preset() method:

Copy to clipboard

```
$this->range->preset();// This will return a value like `DateRangePreset::LastMonth`...
```
