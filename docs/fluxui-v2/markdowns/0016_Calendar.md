# Calendar

A flexible calendar component for date selection. Supports single dates, multiple dates, and date ranges. Perfect for scheduling and booking systems.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar />
```



## Basic Usage

Set the initial selected date using the value prop with a Y-m-d formatted date string:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar value="2026-03-03" />
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar wire:model="date" />
```

Now you can access the selected date from your Livewire component using either a Carbon instance or a Y-m-d formatted string:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Illuminate\Support\Carbon;use Livewire\Component;class BookAppointment extends Component {    public Carbon $date;    public function mount() {        $this->date = now();    }}
```



## [Multiple dates](#multiple-dates)

Select multiple non-consecutive dates.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar multiple />
```

Set multiple selected dates using a comma-separated list in the value prop:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar    multiple    value="2026-03-02,2026-03-05,2026-03-15"/>
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar multiple wire:model="dates" />
```

You can access the selected dates in your Livewire component using an array of Y-m-d formatted date strings:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Illuminate\Support\Carbon;use Livewire\Component;class RequestTimeOff extends Component {    public array $dates = [];    public function mount() {        $this->dates = [            now()->format('Y-m-d'),            now()->addDays(1)->format('Y-m-d'),        ];    }}
```



## [Date range](#date-range)

Select a range of dates.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar mode="range" />
```

Set the initial range using the value prop with a start and end date separated by a forward slash:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar mode="range" value="2026-03-02/2026-03-06" />
```

You can also bind the selection to a Livewire property using wire:model:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar mode="range" wire:model="range" />
```

Now you can access the selected range from your Livewire component using an associative array of Y-m-d formatted date strings:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;class BookFlight extends Component {    public ?array $range;    public function book() {        // ...        $flight->depart_on = $this->range['start'];        $flight->return_on = $this->range['end'];        // ...    }}
```

Alternatively, you can use the specialized DateRange object for enhanced functionality:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class BookFlight extends Component {    public ?DateRange $range;    public function book() {        // ...        $flight->depart_on = $this->range->start();        $flight->return_on = $this->range->end();        // ...    }}
```

We highly recommend using the DateRange object for range selection, it provides a lot of useful functionality.

## Range Configuration

Control range behavior with these props:

Copy to clipboard

```
<!-- Set minimum and maximum range limits --><flux:calendar mode="range" min-range="3" max-range="10" /><!-- Control number of months shown --><flux:calendar mode="range" months="2" />
```



## [Size](#size)

Adjust the calendar's size to fit your layout. Available sizes include xs, sm, lg, xl, and 2xl.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar size="xl" />
```



## [Static](#static)

Create a non-interactive calendar for display purposes.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar    static    value="2026-03-03"    size="xs"    :navigation="false"/>
```



## [Min/max dates](#minmax-dates)

Restrict the selectable date range by setting minimum and maximum boundaries.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar max="2026-03-03" />
```

You can also use the convenient "today" shorthand:

Copy to clipboard

```
<!-- Prevent selection before today... --><flux:calendar min="today" /><!-- Prevent selection after today... --><flux:calendar max="today" />
```



## [Unavailable dates](#unavailable-dates)

Disable specific dates from being selected. Useful for blocking out holidays, showing booked dates, or indicating unavailable time slots.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar unavailable="2026-03-02,2026-03-04" />
```



## [With today shortcut](#with-today-shortcut)

Add a shortcut button to quickly navigate to today's date. When viewing a different month, it jumps to the current month. When already viewing the current month, it selects today's date.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar with-today />
```



## [Selectable header](#selectable-header)

Enable quick navigation by making the month and year in the header selectable.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar selectable-header />
```



## [Fixed weeks](#fixed-weeks)

Display a consistent number of weeks in every month. Prevents layout shifts when navigating between months with different numbers of weeks.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar fixed-weeks />
```



## [Start day](#start-day)

By default, the first day of the week will be automatically set based on the user's locale. You can override this by setting the start-day attribute to any day of the week.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar start-day="1" />
```



## [Open to](#open-to)

Set the date that the calendar will open to, if there is no selected date.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar open-to="2027-04-01" />
```

If you want the calendar to always use the open-to date, you can add the force-open-to attribute.







Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar open-to="2027-04-01" force-open-to />
```



## [Week numbers](#week-numbers)

Display the week number for each week.









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar week-numbers />
```



## [Localization](#localization)

By default, the calendar will use the browser's locale (e.g. navigator.language).

You can override this behavior by setting the locale attribute to any valid locale string (e.g. fr for French, en-US for English, etc.):









Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar locale="ja-JP" />
```



## The DateRange object

Flux provides a specialized Flux\DateRange object that extends the native CarbonPeriod class. This object provides a number of convenience methods to easily create and manage date ranges.

First, it's worth noting that most of the time, you will want to use wire:model.live to bind the range property to a DateRange object. This will automatically update the range property whenever the user selects a date range:

Copy to clipboard

```
<flux:calendar wire:model.live="range" />
```

Now, in your component, you can type hint the range property as a DateRange object:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;}
```



## Instantiation

You can initialize a DateRange object by passing a start and end date to the DateRange constructor from something like the mount method:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public DateRange $range;    public function mount() {        $this->range = new DateRange(now(), now()->addDays(7));    }}
```



## Persisting to the session

You can persist a DateRange object in the user's session by using the #[Session] attribute:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Session;use Livewire\Component;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    #[Session]    public DateRange $range;}
```



## Using with Eloquent

You can use the DateRange object with Eloquent's whereBetween() method to filter queries by date range:

Copy to clipboard

```
<?phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Order;use Flux\DateRange;class Dashboard extends Component {    public ?DateRange $range;    #[Computed]    public function orders() {        return $this->range            ? Order::whereBetween('created_at', $this->range)->get()            : Order::all();    }}
```



## Available methods

The DateRange object extends the native CarbonPeriod class, so it inherits all of its methods. Here are a few examples:

Copy to clipboard

```
$range = new Flux\DateRange(    now()->subDays(1),    now()->addDays(1),);// Get the start and end dates as Carbon instances...$start = $range->start();$end = $range->end();// Check if the range contains a date...$range->contains(now());// Get the number of days in the range...$range->length();// Loop over the range by day...foreach ($range as $date) {    // $date is a Carbon instance...}// Get the range as an array of Carbon instances representing each day in the range...$range->toArray();
```

You can also use it anywhere Eloquent utilities expect a CarbonPeriod instance:

Copy to clipboard

```
$orders = Order::whereBetween('created_at', $range)->get();
```
