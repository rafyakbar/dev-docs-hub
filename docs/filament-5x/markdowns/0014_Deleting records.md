## [​](#creating-a-resource-with-soft-delete)Creating a resource with soft-delete

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the app. If you’d like to add functionality to restore, force-delete and filter trashed records in your resource, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the resource:

Copy

```
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --soft-deletes

```

## [​](#adding-soft-deletes-to-an-existing-resource)Adding soft-deletes to an existing resource

Alternatively, you may add soft-deleting functionality to an existing resource. Firstly, you must update the resource:

Copy

```
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // You may add these actions to your table if you're using a simple
            // resource, or you just want to be able to delete records without
            // leaving the table.
            DeleteAction::make(),
            ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}

public static function getRecordRouteBindingEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getRecordRouteBindingEloquentQuery()
        ->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]);
}

```

Now, update the Edit page class if you have one:

Copy

```
use Filament\Actions;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
        // ...
    ];
}

```

## [​](#deleting-records-on-the-list-page)Deleting records on the List page

By default, you can bulk-delete records in your table. You may also wish to delete single records, using a `DeleteAction`:

Copy

```
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
            DeleteAction::make(),
        ]);
}

```

## [​](#authorization)Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app. Users may delete records if the `delete()` method of the model policy returns `true`. They also have the ability to bulk-delete records if the `deleteAny()` method of the policy returns `true`. Filament uses the `deleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `delete()` policy is not very performant. You can use the `authorizeIndividualRecords()` method on the `BulkDeleteAction` to check the `delete()` policy for each record individually.

### [​](#authorizing-soft-deletes)Authorizing soft-deletes

The `forceDelete()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being force-deleted. `forceDeleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk force-deleted. Filament uses the `forceDeleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `forceDelete()` policy is not very performant. The `restore()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being restored. `restoreAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk restored. Filament uses the `restoreAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `restore()` policy is not very performant.
