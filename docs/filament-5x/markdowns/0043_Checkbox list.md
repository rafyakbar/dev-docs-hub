## [​](#introduction)Introduction

The checkbox list component allows you to select multiple values from a list of predefined options:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])

```

**As well as allowing a static array, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.**

Field

$component

Filament\Forms\Components\Field

The current field component instance.

Get function

$get

Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get

A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run.

Livewire

Eloquent model FQN

$model

?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model>

The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema.

Operation

$operation

string

The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually `create`, `edit`, or `view`.

Raw state

These options are returned in JSON format. If you’re saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

Copy

```
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'technologies' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}

```

## [​](#setting-option-descriptions)Setting option descriptions

You can optionally provide descriptions to each option using the `descriptions()` method. This method accepts an array of plain text strings, or instances of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the descriptions:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->descriptions([
        'tailwind' => 'A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.',
        'alpine' => new HtmlString('A rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior <strong>directly in your markup</strong>.'),
        'laravel' => str('A **web application** framework with expressive, elegant syntax.')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString(),
        'livewire' => 'A full-stack framework for Laravel building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.',
    ])

```

**As well as allowing a static array, the `descriptions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.**

By default, when you arrange checkboxes into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you’d like to list them horizontally, you may use the `gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)` method:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Support\Enums\GridDirection;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)

The value of the option to disable.

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
        'heroicons' => 'SVG icons',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'heroicons')
    ->in(fn (CheckboxList $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))

```

For more information about the `in()` function, please see the [Validation documentation](./validation#in).

## [​](#allowing-html-in-the-option-labels)Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you’d like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowHtml()` method:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml()

```

Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the options should allow HTML or not:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml(FeatureFlag::active())

```

**As well as allowing a static value, the `allowHtml()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.**

## [​](#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship)Integrating with an Eloquent relationship
> If you’re building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form’s model](../components/form#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn’t know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `CheckboxList` to point to a `BelongsToMany` relationship. Filament will load the options from the relationship, and save them back to the relationship’s pivot table when the form is submitted. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')

```

When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `saved()` call from `disabled()` is not applied after the `relationship()` configuration:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->disabled()
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')

```

### [​](#customizing-the-relationship-query)Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the `modifyOptionsQueryUsing` parameter of the `relationship()` method:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )

```

**The `modifyQueryUsing` argument can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.**

### [​](#customizing-the-relationship-option-labels)Customizing the relationship option labels

If you’d like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

Copy

```
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');

```

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'full_name')

```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option’s Eloquent model into a label:

Copy

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")

use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(

## [​](#customizing-the-checkbox-list-action-objects)Customizing the checkbox list action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `selectAllAction()`
- `deselectAllAction()`Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

Copy

```
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->selectAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Select all technologies'),
    )

```

**The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.**
