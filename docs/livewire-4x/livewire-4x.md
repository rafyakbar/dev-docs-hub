Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces using only PHP—no JavaScript required. Instead of writing frontend code in JavaScript frameworks, you write simple PHP classes and Blade templates, and Livewire handles all the complex JavaScript behind the scenes.

To demonstrate, we'll build a simple post creation form with real-time validation. You'll see how Livewire can validate inputs and update the page dynamically without writing a single line of JavaScript or manually handling AJAX requests.

## [#](#prerequisites "Permalink")Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Laravel version 10 or later
- PHP version 8.1 or later


## [#](#install-livewire "Permalink")Install Livewire

From the root directory of your Laravel app, run the following [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) command:

```
composer require livewire/livewire


```


## [#](#create-a-layout "Permalink")Create a layout

Before creating our component, let's set up a layout file that Livewire components will render inside. By default, Livewire looks for a layout at: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

You can create this file by running the following command:

```
php artisan livewire:layout


```
This will generate `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` with the following contents:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        {{ $slot }}

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```
The `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` directives include the necessary JavaScript and CSS assets for Livewire to function. Your component will be rendered in place of the `{{ $slot }}` variable.

## [#](#create-a-livewire-component "Permalink")Create a Livewire component

Livewire provides a convenient Artisan command to generate new components. Run the following command to make a new page component:

```
php artisan make:livewire pages::post.create


```
Since this component will be used as a full page, we use the `pages::` prefix to keep it organized in the pages directory.

This command will generate a new single-file component at `resources/views/pages/post/⚡create.blade.php`.

What's with the ⚡ emoji?

The lightning bolt makes Livewire components instantly recognizable in your editor. It's completely optional and can be disabled in your config if you prefer. See the [components documentation](/docs/4.x/components#creating-components) for more details.

## [#](#write-the-component "Permalink")Write the component

Open `resources/views/pages/post/⚡create.blade.php` and replace its contents with the following:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public string $title = '';

 

    public string $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate([

            'title' => 'required|max:255',

            'content' => 'required',

        ]);

 

        dd($this->title, $this->content);

    }

};

?>

 

<form wire:submit="save">

    <label>

        Title

        <input type="text" wire:model="title">

        @error('title') <span style="color: red;">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </label>

 

    <label>

        Content

        <textarea wire:model="content" rows="5"></textarea>

        @error('content') <span style="color: red;">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </label>

 

    <button type="submit">Save Post</button>

</form>


```


Don't worry about styling

This form is intentionally unstyled so we can focus on Livewire's functionality. In a real application, you'd add CSS or use a framework like Tailwind.

Here's what's happening in the code above:

**Component properties:**

- `public string $title = '';` — Declares a public property for the post title
- `public string $content = '';` — Declares a public property for the post content


**Component methods:**

- `public function save()` — Called when the form is submitted. Validates the data and dumps the output for testing.


**Livewire directives:**

- `wire:submit="save"` — Calls the `save()` method when the form is submitted, preventing the default page reload
- `wire:model="title"` — Creates two-way data binding between the input and the `$title` property. As you type, the property updates automatically
- `wire:model="content"` — Same two-way binding for the textarea and `$content` property
- `@error('title')` and `@error('content')` — Display validation error messages when validation fails


Livewire components MUST have a single root element

Components must have exactly one root HTML element. In this example, the `<form>` element is the single root. Multiple root elements or HTML comments outside the root element will cause an error. When rendering [full-page components](/docs/4.x/pages), named slots for the layout can be placed outside the root element.

In a real application

The `save()` method uses `dd()` to dump the values for testing purposes. In a production application, you would typically save the data to a database and redirect:

```
public function save()

{

    $validated = $this->validate([

        'title' => 'required|max:255',

        'content' => 'required',

    ]);

 

    Post::create($validated); // Assumes you have a Post model and database table

 

    return $this->redirect('/posts');

}


```

## [#](#register-a-route "Permalink")Register a route

Open the `routes/web.php` file in your Laravel application and add the following:

```
Route::livewire('/post/create', 'pages::post.create');


```
Now when a user visits `/post/create`, Livewire will render the `pages::post.create` component inside your layout file.

## [#](#test-it-out "Permalink")Test it out

With everything in place, let's test the component!

Start your Laravel development server if it's not already running:

```
php artisan serve


```
Visit `http://localhost:8000/post/create` in your browser (or `http://yourapp.test/post/create` if using Valet, Herd, or a similar tool).

You should see a simple form with two fields and a submit button.

**Try the following:**

1. **Test validation:** Click "Save Post" without filling in any fields. You'll see red error messages appear instantly below each field—no page reload required.

2. **Test submission:** Fill in both fields and click "Save Post". You should see a debug screen showing the values you entered.

This demonstrates Livewire's core power: reactive data binding, real-time validation, and form handling—all written in PHP without touching JavaScript.

## [#](#troubleshooting "Permalink")Troubleshooting

**Component not found error:**

- Make sure the component file exists at `resources/views/pages/post/⚡create.blade.php`
- Check that the component name in the route matches: `'pages::post.create'`


**Form doesn't submit or validation doesn't show:**

- Make sure `@livewireStyles` is in your `<head>` and `@livewireScripts` is before `</body>` in your layout
- Check your browser console for JavaScript errors


**404 error when visiting the route:**

- Verify the route was added to `routes/web.php`


## [#](#next-steps "Permalink")Next steps

# 0002_Installation

# Installation

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire is a Laravel package, so you will need to have a Laravel application up and running before you can install and use Livewire. If you need help setting up a new Laravel application, please see the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/installation).

## [#](#prerequisites "Permalink")Prerequisites

Before installing Livewire, make sure you have:

- Laravel version 10 or later
- PHP version 8.1 or later


## [#](#install-livewire "Permalink")Install Livewire

To install Livewire, open your terminal and navigate to your Laravel application directory, then run the following command:

```
composer require livewire/livewire


```
That's it! Livewire uses Laravel's package auto-discovery, so no additional setup is required.

**Ready to build your first component?** Head over to the [Quickstart guide](/docs/4.x/quickstart) to create your first Livewire component in minutes.

## [#](#create-a-layout-file "Permalink")Create a layout file

When using Livewire components as full pages, you'll need a layout file. You can generate one using the Livewire command:

```
php artisan livewire:layout


```
This creates a layout file at `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` with the following contents:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        {{ $slot }}

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```
The `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` directives include the necessary JavaScript and CSS assets for Livewire to function. Livewire bundles Alpine.js with its JavaScript, so both are loaded together.

Asset injection is automatic

Even without these directives, Livewire will automatically inject its assets into pages that contain Livewire components. However, including the directives gives you explicit control over where the assets are placed, which can be helpful for performance optimization or compatibility with other packages.

## [#](#publishing-the-configuration-file "Permalink")Publishing the configuration file

Livewire is "zero-config", meaning you can use it by following conventions without any additional configuration. However, if needed, you can publish and customize Livewire's configuration file:

```
php artisan livewire:config


```
This will create a new `livewire.php` file in your Laravel application's `config` directory where you can customize various Livewire settings.

---


# Advanced configuration

The following sections cover advanced scenarios that most applications won't need. Only configure these if you have a specific requirement.

## [#](#manually-bundling-livewire-and-alpine "Permalink")Manually bundling Livewire and Alpine

**When you need this:** If you want to use Alpine.js plugins or need fine-grained control over when Alpine and Livewire initialize.

By default, Livewire automatically loads Alpine.js bundled with its JavaScript. However, if you need to register Alpine plugins or customize the initialization order, you can manually bundle Livewire and Alpine using your JavaScript build tool.

First, add the `@livewireScriptConfig` directive to your layout file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        {{ $slot }}

 

        @livewireScriptConfig

    </body>

</html>


```
The `@livewireScriptConfig` directive injects configuration and runtime globals that Livewire needs, but without the actual Livewire and Alpine JavaScript (since you're bundling those yourself). Replace `@livewireScripts` with `@livewireScriptConfig` when manually bundling.

Next, import and start Livewire and Alpine in your `resources/js/app.js` file:

```
import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';

import Clipboard from '@ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard'

 

Alpine.plugin(Clipboard)

 

Livewire.start()


```


Rebuild assets after Livewire updates

When manually bundling, remember to rebuild your JavaScript assets (`npm run build`) whenever you update Livewire via Composer.

## [#](#customizing-livewires-update-endpoint "Permalink")Customizing Livewire's update endpoint

**When you need this:** If your application uses route prefixes for localization (like `/en/`, `/fr/`) or multi-tenancy (like `/tenant-1/`, `/tenant-2/`), you may need to customize Livewire's update endpoint to match your routing structure.

By default, Livewire sends component updates to a hash-based endpoint like `/livewire-{hash}/update`, where `{hash}` is derived from your application's `APP_KEY`. To customize this, register your own route in a service provider (typically `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`):

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider

{

    public function boot()

    {

        Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $path) {

            return Route::post('/custom' . $path, $handle);

        });

    }

}


```
The `$path` parameter contains the hash-based path (e.g., `/livewire-{hash}/update`), preserving the unique-per-installation endpoint.

You can also add middleware to the update route:

```
Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $path) {

    return Route::post('/custom' . $path, $handle)

        ->middleware(['web', 'auth']);

});


```


## [#](#customizing-the-javascript-asset-url "Permalink")Customizing the JavaScript asset URL

**When you need this:** If your application uses route prefixes for localization or multi-tenancy, you may need to customize where Livewire serves its JavaScript from to match your routing structure.

By default, Livewire serves its JavaScript from a hash-based endpoint like `/livewire-{hash}/livewire.js`, where `{hash}` is derived from your application's `APP_KEY`. This unique-per-installation path makes it harder to target Livewire applications with automated scanners.

To customize this, register your own route in a service provider:

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider

{

    public function boot()

    {

        Livewire::setScriptRoute(function ($handle, $path) {

            return Route::get('/custom' . $path, $handle);

        });

    }

}


```
The `$path` parameter contains the hash-based path (e.g., `/livewire-{hash}/livewire.js`), preserving the unique-per-installation endpoint.

## [#](#publishing-livewires-assets-to-public-directory "Permalink")Publishing Livewire's assets to public directory

**When you need this:** If you want to serve Livewire's JavaScript through your web server directly (e.g., for CDN distribution or specific caching strategies) instead of Laravel routing.

You can publish Livewire's JavaScript assets to your `public` directory:

```
php artisan livewire:publish --assets


```
To ensure assets stay up-to-date when you update Livewire, add this to your `composer.json`:

```
{

    "scripts": {

        "post-update-cmd": [

            "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire:assets --ansi --force"

        ]

    }

}


```


Most applications don't need this

Publishing assets is rarely necessary. Only do this if you have a specific architectural requirement that prevents Laravel from serving the assets dynamically.

## [#](#disabling-automatic-asset-injection "Permalink")Disabling automatic asset injection

**When you need this:** If you want complete control over when and how Livewire's assets are loaded, you can disable automatic injection.

Update the `inject_assets` configuration option in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'inject_assets' => false,


```
When disabled, you must manually include `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` in your layouts, or Livewire won't function.

Alternatively, you can force asset injection on specific pages:

```
\Livewire\Livewire::forceAssetInjection();


```
Call this in a route or controller where you want to ensure assets are injected.

# Troubleshooting

## [#](#livewire-javascript-not-loading-404-error "Permalink")Livewire JavaScript not loading (404 error)

**Symptom:** Livewire's JavaScript file returns a 404 error, or Livewire features don't work.

Livewire serves its JavaScript from a hash-based endpoint like `/livewire-{hash}/livewire.js`, where `{hash}` is derived from your application's `APP_KEY`. This unique path varies per installation.

**Common causes:**

**Nginx configuration blocking the route:** If you're using Nginx with a custom configuration, it may be blocking Laravel's dynamic Livewire routes. You can either:

- Configure Nginx to pass requests matching `/livewire-*/` to Laravel (e.g., `location ~ ^/livewire-[a-f0-9]+/ { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string; }`)
- [Manually bundle Livewire](#manually-bundling-livewire-and-alpine) to avoid serving through Laravel
- [Publish Livewire's assets](#publishing-livewires-assets-to-public-directory) to serve them directly from your web server


**Route caching:** If you've run `php artisan route:cache`, Laravel may not recognize Livewire's routes. Clear the cache:

```
php artisan route:clear


```
**Missing @livewireScripts:** If you've disabled automatic asset injection, ensure `@livewireScripts` is in your layout file before `</body>`.

## [#](#alpinejs-not-available-on-pages-without-livewire-components "Permalink")Alpine.js not available on pages without Livewire components

**Symptom:** You want to use Alpine.js on a page that doesn't have any Livewire components.

**Solution:** Since Alpine is bundled with Livewire, you need to include `@livewireScripts` even on pages without Livewire components:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

    <head>

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        <!-- No Livewire components, but we want Alpine -->

        <div x-data="{ open: false }">

            <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>

        </div>

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```
Alternatively, [manually bundle Livewire and Alpine](#manually-bundling-livewire-and-alpine) and import Alpine in your JavaScript.

## [#](#components-not-updating-or-errors-in-browser-console "Permalink")Components not updating or errors in browser console

**Check the following:**

- Ensure `@livewireStyles` is in the `<head>` of your layout
- Ensure `@livewireScripts` is before `</body>` in your layout
- Check your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors
- Verify you're running a supported PHP version (8.1+) and Laravel version (10+)
- Clear your application cache: `php artisan cache:clear`


If issues persist, check the [troubleshooting documentation](/docs/4.x/troubleshooting) for more detailed debugging steps.




# 0003_Upgrade Guide

# Upgrade Guide

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire v4 introduces several improvements and optimizations while maintaining backward compatibility wherever possible. This guide will help you upgrade from Livewire v3 to v4.

Smooth upgrade path

Most applications can upgrade to v4 with minimal changes. The breaking changes are primarily configuration updates and method signature changes that only affect advanced usage.

Want to save time? You can use [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com) to help automate your application upgrades.

## [#](#installation "Permalink")Installation

Update your `composer.json` to require Livewire v4:

```
composer require livewire/livewire:^4.0


```
After updating, clear your application's cache:

```
php artisan optimize:clear


```


View all changes on GitHub

For a complete overview of all code changes between v3 and v4, you can review the full diff on GitHub: [Compare 3.x to main →](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/compare/3.x...main)

## [#](#upgrading-to-v41-from-v40 "Permalink")Upgrading to v4.1 from v4.0

### [#](#wiremodel-modifier-behavior-change "Permalink")`wire:model` modifier behavior change

Modifiers like `.blur` and `.change` now control when client-side state syncs, not just network timing. If you're using these modifiers and want the previous behavior, add `.live` before them (e.g., `wire:model.live.blur`).

[See full details below →](#wiremodel-modifiers-now-control-client-side-sync-timing)

---


The following changes apply when upgrading from v3 to v4.

## [#](#high-impact-changes "Permalink")High-impact changes

These changes are most likely to affect your application and should be reviewed carefully.

### [#](#config-file-updates "Permalink")Config file updates

Several configuration keys have been renamed, reorganized, or have new defaults. Update your `config/livewire.php` file:

View the full config file

For reference, you can view the complete v4 config file on GitHub: [livewire.php →](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/blob/main/config/livewire.php)

#### [#](#renamed-configuration-keys "Permalink")Renamed configuration keys

**Layout configuration:**

```
// Before (v3)

'layout' => 'components.layouts.app',

 

// After (v4)

'component_layout' => 'layouts::app',


```
The layout now uses the `layouts::` namespace by default, pointing to `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.

**Placeholder configuration:**

```
// Before (v3)

'lazy_placeholder' => 'livewire.placeholder',

 

// After (v4)

'component_placeholder' => 'livewire.placeholder',


```


#### [#](#changed-defaults "Permalink")Changed defaults

**Smart wire:key behavior:**

```
// Now defaults to true (was false in v3)

'smart_wire_keys' => true,


```
This helps prevent wire:key issues on deeply nested components. Note: You still need to add `wire:key` manually in loops—this setting doesn't eliminate that requirement.

[Learn more about wire:key →](/docs/4.x/nesting#rendering-children-in-a-loop)

#### [#](#new-configuration-options "Permalink")New configuration options

**Component locations:**

```
'component_locations' => [

    resource_path('views/components'),

    resource_path('views/livewire'),

],


```
Defines where Livewire looks for single-file and multi-file (view-based) components.

**Component namespaces:**

```
'component_namespaces' => [

    'layouts' => resource_path('views/layouts'),

    'pages' => resource_path('views/pages'),

],


```
Creates custom namespaces for organizing view-based components (e.g., `<livewire:pages::dashboard />`).

**Make command defaults:**

```
'make_command' => [

    'type' => 'sfc',  // Options: 'sfc', 'mfc', or 'class'

    'emoji' => true,   // Whether to use ⚡ emoji prefix

],


```
Configure default component format and emoji usage. Set `type` to `'class'` to match v3 behavior.

**CSP-safe mode:**

```
'csp_safe' => false,


```
Enable Content Security Policy mode to avoid `unsafe-eval` violations. When enabled, Livewire uses the [Alpine CSP build](https://alpinejs.dev/advanced/csp). Note: This mode restricts complex JavaScript expressions in directives like `wire:click="addToCart($event.detail.productId)"` or global references like `window.location`.

### [#](#routing-changes "Permalink")Routing changes

For full-page components, the recommended routing approach has changed:

```
// Before (v3) - still works but not recommended

Route::get('/dashboard', Dashboard::class);

 

// After (v4) - recommended for all component types

Route::livewire('/dashboard', Dashboard::class);

 

// For view-based components, you can use the component name

Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard');


```
Using `Route::livewire()` is now the preferred method and is required for single-file and multi-file components to work correctly as full-page components.

[Learn more about routing →](/docs/4.x/components#page-components)

### [#](#wiremodel-now-ignores-child-events-by-default "Permalink")`wire:model` now ignores child events by default

In v3, `wire:model` would respond to input/change events that bubbled up from child elements. This caused unexpected behavior when using `wire:model` on container elements (like modals or accordions) that contained form inputs—clearing an input inside would bubble up and potentially close the modal.

In v4, `wire:model` now only listens for events originating directly on the element itself (equivalent to the `.self` modifier behavior).

If you have code that relies on capturing events from child elements, add the `.deep` modifier:

```
<!-- Before (v3) - listened to child events by default -->

<div wire:model="value">

    <input type="text">

</div>

 

<!-- After (v4) - add .deep to restore old behavior -->

<div wire:model.deep="value">

    <input type="text">

</div>


```


Most apps won't need changes

This change primarily affects non-standard uses of `wire:model` on container elements. Standard form input bindings (inputs, selects, textareas) are unaffected.

### [#](#use-wirenavigatescroll "Permalink")Use `wire:navigate:scroll`

When using `wire:scroll` to preserve scroll in a scrollable container across `wire:navigate` requests in v3, you will need to instead use `wire:navigate:scroll` in v4:

```
 @persist('sidebar')

-    <div class="overflow-y-scroll" wire:scroll> <!--  -->

+    <div class="overflow-y-scroll" wire:navigate:scroll> <!--  -->

         <!-- ... -->

     </div>

 @endpersist


```


### [#](#component-tags-must-be-closed "Permalink")Component tags must be closed

In v3, Livewire component tags would render even without being properly closed. In v4, with the addition of slot support, component tags must be properly closed—otherwise Livewire interprets subsequent content as slot content and the component won't render:

```
<!-- Before (v3) - unclosed tag -->

<livewire:component-name>

 

<!-- After (v4) - Self-closing tag -->

<livewire:component-name />


```
[Learn more about rendering components →](/docs/4.x/components#rendering-components)

[Learn more about slots →](/docs/4.x/nesting#slots)

## [#](#medium-impact-changes "Permalink")Medium-impact changes

These changes may affect certain parts of your application depending on which features you use.

### [#](#wiremodel-modifiers-now-control-client-side-sync-timing "Permalink")`wire:model` modifiers now control client-side sync timing

In v3, modifiers like `.blur` and `.change` only controlled when network requests were sent. The input's value was always synced to client-side state (`$wire.property`) immediately as the user typed.

In v4, these modifiers now control when client-side state syncs too. This unlocks new UI patterns—like inputs that don't update until the user finishes typing and hits Enter or tabs away.

**Migration:** If you're using `.blur` or `.change` and want the old behavior, add `.live` before the modifier:

```
<!-- v3 -->

<input wire:model.blur="title">

 

<!-- v4 equivalent -->

<input wire:model.live.blur="title">


```

| v3 Syntax | v4 Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `wire:model.blur` | `wire:model.live.blur` |
| `wire:model.change` | `wire:model.live.change` |


`.lazy` is backwards compatible

`wire:model.lazy` continues to work as it did in v3—no migration needed.

**New in v4:** You can now delay client-side updates without sending network requests:

```
<!-- Only update $wire.width when user tabs away -->

<input wire:model.blur="width">

 

<!-- Update on Enter key or blur -->

<input wire:model.blur.enter="search">


```

### [#](#wiretransition-now-uses-view-transitions-api "Permalink")`wire:transition` now uses View Transitions API

In v3, `wire:transition` was a wrapper around Alpine's `x-transition` directive, supporting modifiers like `.opacity`, `.scale`, `.duration.200ms`, and `.origin.top`.

In v4, `wire:transition` uses the browser's native [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) instead. Basic usage still works—elements will fade in and out smoothly—but all modifiers have been removed.

```
 <!-- This still works in v4 -->

 <div wire:transition>...</div>

  

 <!-- These modifiers are no longer supported -->

-<div wire:transition.opacity>...</div>

-<div wire:transition.scale.origin.top>...</div>

-<div wire:transition.duration.500ms>...</div>


```

### [#](#performance-improvements "Permalink")Performance improvements

Livewire v4 includes significant performance improvements to the request handling system:

- **Non-blocking polling**: `wire:poll` no longer blocks other requests or is blocked by them
- **Parallel live updates**: `wire:model.live` requests now run in parallel, allowing faster typing and quicker results


These improvements happen automatically—no changes needed to your code.

### [#](#update-hooks-consolidate-arrayobject-changes "Permalink")Update hooks consolidate array/object changes

When replacing an entire array or object from the frontend (e.g., `$wire.items = ['new', 'values']`), Livewire now sends a single consolidated update instead of granular updates for each index.

**Before:** Setting `$wire.items = ['a', 'b']` on an array of 4 items would fire `updatingItems`/`updatedItems` hooks multiple times—once for each index change plus `__rm__` removals.

**After:** The same operation fires the hooks once with the full new array value, matching v2 behavior.

If your code relies on individual index hooks firing when replacing entire arrays, you may need to adjust. Single-item changes (like `wire:model="items.0"`) still fire granular hooks as expected.

### [#](#method-signature-changes "Permalink")Method signature changes

If you're extending Livewire's core functionality or using these methods directly, note these signature changes:

**Streaming:**

The `stream()` method parameter order has changed:

```
// Before (v3)

$this->stream(to: '#container', content: 'Hello', replace: true);

 

// After (v4)

$this->stream(content: 'Hello', replace: true, el: '#container');


```
If you're using named parameters (as shown above), note that `to:` has been renamed to `el:`. If you're using positional parameters, you'll need to update to the following:

```
// Before (v3) - positional parameters

$this->stream('#container', 'Hello');

 

// After (v4) - positional/named parameters

$this->stream('Hello', el: '#container');


```
[Learn more about streaming →](/docs/4.x/wire-stream)

**Component mounting (internal):**

If you're extending `LivewireManager` or calling the `mount()` method directly:

```
// Before (v3)

public function mount($name, $params = [], $key = null)

 

// After (v4)

public function mount($name, $params = [], $key = null, $slots = [])


```
This change adds support for passing slots when mounting components and generally won't affect most applications.

## [#](#low-impact-changes "Permalink")Low-impact changes

These changes only affect applications using advanced features or customization.

### [#](#livewire-asset-and-endpoint-url-changes "Permalink")Livewire Asset and Endpoint URL Changes

All Livewire URLs now include a unique hash derived from your `APP_KEY`. The prefix changed from `/livewire/` to `/livewire-{hash}/`:

```
# v3                          # v4

/livewire/update        →     /livewire-{hash}/update

/livewire/upload-file   →     /livewire-{hash}/upload-file

/livewire/livewire.js   →     /livewire-{hash}/livewire.js


```
If your firewall rules, CDN config, or middleware reference `/livewire/` paths, update them to account for the new prefix.

If you're using `setUpdateRoute`, use the `$path` parameter to preserve the hash-based endpoint:

```
// Before (v3)

Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle) {

    return Route::post('/livewire/update', $handle);

});

 

// After (v4)

Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $path) {

    return Route::post($path, $handle);

});


```

### [#](#javascript-deprecations "Permalink")JavaScript deprecations

#### [#](#deprecated-wirejs-method "Permalink")Deprecated: `$wire.$js()` method

The `$wire.$js()` method for defining JavaScript actions has been deprecated:

```
// Deprecated (v3)

$wire.$js('bookmark', () => {

    // Toggle bookmark...

})

 

// New (v4)

$wire.$js.bookmark = () => {

    // Toggle bookmark...

}


```
The new syntax is cleaner and more intuitive.

#### [#](#deprecated-js-without-prefix "Permalink")Deprecated: `$js` without prefix

The use of `$js` in scripts without `$wire.$js` or `this.$js` prefix has been deprecated:

```
// Deprecated (v3)

$js('bookmark', () => {

    // Toggle bookmark...

})

 

// New (v4)

$wire.$js.bookmark = () => {

    // Toggle bookmark...

}

// Or

this.$js.bookmark = () => {

    // Toggle bookmark...

}


```


Old syntax still works

Both `$wire.$js('bookmark', ...)` and `$js('bookmark', ...)` will continue to work in v4 for backward compatibility, but you should migrate to the new syntax when convenient.

#### [#](#deprecated-commit-and-request-hooks "Permalink")Deprecated: `commit` and `request` hooks

The `commit` and `request` hooks have been deprecated in favor of a new interceptor system that provides more granular control and better performance.

Old hooks still work

The deprecated hooks will continue to work in v4 for backward compatibility, but you should migrate to the new system when convenient.

#### [#](#migrating-from-commit-hook "Permalink")Migrating from `commit` hook

The old `commit` hook:

```
// OLD - Deprecated

Livewire.hook('commit', ({ component, commit, respond, succeed, fail }) => {

    respond(() => {

        // Runs after response received but before processing

    })

 

    succeed(({ snapshot, effects }) => {

        // Runs after successful response

    })

 

    fail(() => {

        // Runs if request failed

    })

})


```
Should be replaced with the new `interceptMessage`:

```
// NEW - Recommended

Livewire.interceptMessage(({ component, message, onFinish, onSuccess, onError, onFailure }) => {

    onFinish(() => {

        // Equivalent to respond()

    })

 

    onSuccess(({ payload }) => {

        // Equivalent to succeed()

        // Access snapshot via payload.snapshot

        // Access effects via payload.effects

    })

 

    onError(() => {

        // Equivalent to fail() for server errors

    })

 

    onFailure(() => {

        // Equivalent to fail() for network errors

    })

})


```


#### [#](#migrating-from-request-hook "Permalink")Migrating from `request` hook

The old `request` hook:

```
// OLD - Deprecated

Livewire.hook('request', ({ url, options, payload, respond, succeed, fail }) => {

    respond(({ status, response }) => {

        // Runs when response received

    })

 

    succeed(({ status, json }) => {

        // Runs on successful response

    })

 

    fail(({ status, content, preventDefault }) => {

        // Runs on failed response

    })

})


```
Should be replaced with the new `interceptRequest`:

```
// NEW - Recommended

Livewire.interceptRequest(({ request, onResponse, onSuccess, onError, onFailure }) => {

    // Access url via request.uri

    // Access options via request.options

    // Access payload via request.payload

 

    onResponse(({ response }) => {

        // Equivalent to respond()

        // Access status via response.status

    })

 

    onSuccess(({ response, responseJson }) => {

        // Equivalent to succeed()

        // Access status via response.status

        // Access json via responseJson

    })

 

    onError(({ response, responseBody, preventDefault }) => {

        // Equivalent to fail() for server errors

        // Access status via response.status

        // Access content via responseBody

    })

 

    onFailure(({ error }) => {

        // Equivalent to fail() for network errors

    })

})


```


#### [#](#key-differences "Permalink")Key differences

1. **More granular error handling**: The new system separates network failures (`onFailure`) from server errors (`onError`)
2. **Better lifecycle hooks**: Message interceptors provide additional hooks like `onSync`, `onMorph`, and `onRender`
3. **Cancellation support**: Both messages and requests can be cancelled/aborted
4. **Component scoping**: Message interceptors can be scoped to specific components using `$wire.intercept(...)`


For complete documentation on the new interceptor system, see the [JavaScript Interceptors documentation](/docs/4.x/javascript#interceptors).

## [#](#upgrading-volt "Permalink")Upgrading Volt

Livewire v4 now supports single-file components, which use the same syntax as Volt class-based components. This means you can migrate from Volt to Livewire's built-in single-file components.

### [#](#update-component-imports "Permalink")Update component imports

Replace all instances of `Livewire\Volt\Component` with `Livewire\Component`:

```
// Before (Volt)

use Livewire\Volt\Component;

 

new class extends Component { ... }

 

// After (Livewire v4)

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component { ... }


```


### [#](#update-route-definitions "Permalink")Update route definitions

Replace `Volt::route()` with `Route::livewire()` in your routes files:

```
// Before (Volt)

use Livewire\Volt\Volt;

 

Volt::route('/dashboard', 'dashboard');

 

// After (Livewire v4)

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

 

Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'dashboard');


```


### [#](#update-test-files "Permalink")Update test files

Replace all instances of `Livewire\Volt\Volt` with `Livewire\Livewire` and change `Volt::test()` to `Livewire::test()`:

```
// Before (Volt)

use Livewire\Volt\Volt;

 

Volt::test('counter')

 

// After (Livewire v4)

use Livewire\Livewire;

 

Livewire::test('counter')


```


### [#](#remove-volt-service-provider "Permalink")Remove Volt service provider

Delete the Volt service provider file:

```
rm app/Providers/VoltServiceProvider.php


```
Then remove it from the providers array in `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```
// Before

return [

    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,

    App\Providers\VoltServiceProvider::class,

];

 

// After

return [

    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,

];


```


### [#](#remove-volt-package "Permalink")Remove Volt package

Uninstall the Volt package:

```
composer remove livewire/volt


```


### [#](#install-livewire-v4 "Permalink")Install Livewire v4

After completing the above changes, install Livewire v4. Your existing Volt class-based components will work without modification since they use the same syntax as Livewire's single-file components.

## [#](#new-features-in-v4 "Permalink")New features in v4

Livewire v4 introduces several powerful new features you can start using immediately:

### [#](#component-features "Permalink")Component features

**Single-file and multi-file components**

v4 introduces new component formats alongside the traditional class-based approach. Single-file components combine PHP and Blade in one file, while multi-file components organize PHP, Blade, JavaScript, and tests in a directory.

By default, view-based component files are prefixed with a ⚡ emoji to distinguish them from regular Blade files in your editor and searches. This can be disabled via the `make_command.emoji` config.

```
php artisan make:livewire create-post        # Single-file (default)

php artisan make:livewire create-post --mfc  # Multi-file

php artisan livewire:convert create-post     # Convert between formats


```
[Learn more about component formats →](/docs/4.x/components)

**Slots and attribute forwarding**

Components now support slots and automatic attribute bag forwarding using `{{ $attributes }}`, making component composition more flexible.

[Learn more about nesting components →](/docs/4.x/nesting)

**JavaScript in view-based components**

View-based components can now include `<script>` tags without the `@script` wrapper. These scripts are served as separate cached files for better performance and automatic `$wire` binding:

```
<div>

    <!-- Your component template -->

</div>

 

<script>

    // $wire is automatically bound as 'this'

    this.count++  // Same as $wire.count++

 

    // $wire is still available if preferred

    $wire.save()

</script>


```
[Learn more about JavaScript in components →](/docs/4.x/javascript)

### [#](#islands "Permalink")Islands

Islands allow you to create isolated regions within a component that update independently, dramatically improving performance without creating separate child components.

```
@island(name: 'stats', lazy: true)

    <div>{{ $this->expensiveStats }}</div>

@endisland


```
[Learn more about islands →](/docs/4.x/islands)

### [#](#loading-improvements "Permalink")Loading improvements

**Deferred loading**

In addition to lazy loading (viewport-based), components can now be deferred to load immediately after the initial page load:

```
<livewire:revenue defer />


```

```
#[Defer]

class Revenue extends Component { ... }


```
**Bundled loading**

Control whether multiple lazy/deferred components load in parallel or bundled together:

```
<livewire:revenue lazy.bundle />

<livewire:expenses defer.bundle />


```

```
#[Lazy(bundle: true)]

class Revenue extends Component { ... }


```
[Learn more about lazy and deferred loading →](/docs/4.x/lazy)

### [#](#async-actions "Permalink")Async actions

Run actions in parallel without blocking other requests using the `.async` modifier or `#[Async]` attribute:

```
<button wire:click.async="logActivity">Track</button>


```

```
#[Async]

public function logActivity() { ... }


```
[Learn more about async actions →](/docs/4.x/actions#parallel-execution-with-async)

### [#](#new-directives-and-modifiers "Permalink")New directives and modifiers

**`wire:sort` - Drag-and-drop sorting**

Built-in support for sortable lists with drag-and-drop:

```
<ul wire:sort="updateOrder">

    @foreach ($items as $item)

        <li wire:sort:item="{{ $item->id }}" wire:key="{{ $item->id }}">{{ $item->name }}</li>

    @endforeach

</ul>


```
[Learn more about wire:sort →](/docs/4.x/wire-sort)

**`wire:intersect` - Viewport intersection**

Run actions when elements enter or leave the viewport, similar to Alpine's [`x-intersect`](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/intersect):

```
<!-- Basic usage -->

<div wire:intersect="loadMore">...</div>

 

<!-- With modifiers -->

<div wire:intersect.once="trackView">...</div>

<div wire:intersect:leave="pauseVideo">...</div>

<div wire:intersect.half="loadMore">...</div>

<div wire:intersect.full="startAnimation">...</div>

 

<!-- With options -->

<div wire:intersect.margin.200px="loadMore">...</div>

<div wire:intersect.threshold.50="trackScroll">...</div>


```
Available modifiers:

- `.once` - Fire only once
- `.half` - Wait until half is visible
- `.full` - Wait until fully visible
- `.threshold.X` - Custom visibility percentage (0-100)
- `.margin.Xpx` or `.margin.X%` - Intersection margin


[Learn more about wire:intersect →](/docs/4.x/wire-intersect)

**`wire:ref` - Element references**

Easily reference and interact with elements in your template:

```
<div wire:ref="modal">

    <!-- Modal content -->

</div>

 

<button wire:click="$js.scrollToModal">Scroll to modal</button>

 

<script>

    this.$js.scrollToModal = () => {

        this.$refs.modal.scrollIntoView()

    }

</script>


```
[Learn more about wire:ref →](/docs/4.x/wire-ref)

**`.renderless` modifier**

Skip component re-rendering directly from the template:

```
<button wire:click.renderless="trackClick">Track</button>


```
This is an alternative to the `#[Renderless]` attribute for actions that don't need to update the UI.

**`.preserve-scroll` modifier**

Preserve scroll position during updates to prevent layout jumps:

```
<button wire:click.preserve-scroll="loadMore">Load More</button>


```
**`data-loading` attribute**

Every element that triggers a network request automatically receives a `data-loading` attribute, making it easy to style loading states with Tailwind:

```
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50 data-loading:pointer-events-none">

    Save Changes

</button>


```
[Learn more about loading states →](/docs/4.x/loading-states)

### [#](#javascript-improvements "Permalink")JavaScript improvements

**`$errors` magic property**

Access your component's error bag from JavaScript:

```
<div wire:show="$errors.has('email')">

    <span wire:text="$errors.first('email')"></span>

</div>


```
[Learn more about validation →](/docs/4.x/validation)

**`$intercept` magic**

Intercept and modify Livewire requests from JavaScript:

```
<script>

this.$intercept('save', ({ ... }) => {

    // ...

})

</script>


```
[Learn more about JavaScript interceptors →](/docs/4.x/javascript#interceptors)

# 0004_Components

# Components

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire components are essentially PHP classes with properties and methods that can be called directly from a Blade template. This powerful combination allows you to create full-stack interactive interfaces with a fraction of the effort and complexity of modern JavaScript alternatives.

This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, rendering, and organizing Livewire components. You'll learn about the different component formats available (single-file, multi-file, and class-based), how to pass data between components, and how to use components as full pages.

## [#](#creating-components "Permalink")Creating components

You can create a component using the `make:livewire` Artisan command:

```
php artisan make:livewire post.create


```
This creates a single-file component at:

`resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php`

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        // Save logic here...

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input wire:model="title" type="text">

    <button wire:click="save">Save Post</button>

</div>


```


Why the ⚡ emoji?

You might be wondering about the lightning bolt in the filename. This small touch serves a practical purpose: it makes Livewire components instantly recognizable in your editor's file tree and search results. Since it's a Unicode character, it works seamlessly across all platforms — Windows, macOS, Linux, Git, and your production servers.

The emoji is completely optional and if you find it outside your comfort zone you can disable it entirely in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'make_command' => [

    'emoji' => false,

],


```

### [#](#creating-page-components "Permalink")Creating page components

When creating components that will be used as full pages, use the `pages::` namespace to organize them in a dedicated directory:

```
php artisan make:livewire pages::post.create


```
This creates the component at `resources/views/pages/post/⚡create.blade.php`. This organization makes it clear which components are pages versus reusable UI components.

Learn more about using components as pages in the [Page components section](#page-components) below. You can also register your own custom namespaces—see the [Component namespaces documentation](/docs/4.x/components#component-namespaces).

### [#](#multi-file-components "Permalink")Multi-file components

As your component or project grows, you might find the single-file approach limiting. Livewire offers a multi-file alternative that splits your component into separate files for better organization and IDE support.

To create a multi-file component, pass the `--mfc` flag:

```
php artisan make:livewire post.create --mfc


```
This creates a directory with all related files together:

```
resources/views/components/post/⚡create/

├── create.php          # PHP class

├── create.blade.php    # Blade template

├── create.js           # JavaScript (optional)

├── create.css          # Scoped styles (optional)

├── create.global.css   # Global styles (optional)

└── create.test.php     # Pest test (optional, with --test flag)


```


### [#](#converting-between-formats "Permalink")Converting between formats

Livewire provides the `livewire:convert` command to seamlessly convert components between single-file and multi-file formats.

**Auto-detect and convert:**

```
php artisan livewire:convert post.create

# Single-file → Multi-file (or vice versa)


```
**Explicitly convert to multi-file:**

```
php artisan livewire:convert post.create --mfc


```
This will parse your single-file component, create a directory structure, split the files, and delete the original.

**Explicitly convert to single-file:**

```
php artisan livewire:convert post.create --sfc


```
This combines all files back into a single file and deletes the directory.

Test files are deleted when converting to single-file

If your multi-file component has a test file, you'll be prompted to confirm before conversion since test files cannot be preserved in the single-file format.

### [#](#when-to-use-each-format "Permalink")When to use each format

**Single-file components (default):**

- Best for most components
- Keeps related code together
- Easy to understand at a glance
- Perfect for small to medium components


**Multi-file components:**

- Better for large, complex components
- Improved IDE support and navigation
- Clearer separation when components have significant JavaScript


**Class-based components:**

- Familiar to developers from Livewire v2/v3
- Traditional Laravel separation of concerns
- Better for teams with established conventions
- See [Class-based components](#class-based-components) below


## [#](#rendering-components "Permalink")Rendering components

You can include a Livewire component within any Blade template using the `<livewire:component-name />` syntax:

```
<livewire:component-name />


```
If the component is located in a sub-directory, you can indicate this using the dot (`.`) character:

`resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php`

```
<livewire:post.create />


```
For namespaced components—like `pages::`—use the namespace prefix:

```
<livewire:pages::post.create />


```


### [#](#passing-props "Permalink")Passing props

To pass data into a Livewire component, you can use prop attributes on the component tag:

```
<livewire:post.create title="Initial Title" />


```
For dynamic values or variables, prefix the attribute with a colon:

```
<livewire:post.create :title="$initialTitle" />


```
Data passed into components is received through the `mount()` method:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title;

 

    public function mount($title = null)

    {

        $this->title = $title;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
You can think of the `mount()` method as a class constructor. It runs when the component initializes, but not on subsequent requests within a page's session. You can learn more about `mount()` and other helpful lifecycle hooks within the [lifecycle documentation](/docs/4.x/lifecycle-hooks).

To reduce boilerplate code, you can omit the `mount()` method and Livewire will automatically set any properties with names matching the passed values:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title; // Automatically set from prop

 

    // ...

};


```


These properties are not reactive by default

The `$title` property will not update automatically if the outer `:title="$initialValue"` changes after the initial page load. This is a common point of confusion when using Livewire, especially for developers who have used JavaScript frameworks like Vue or React and assume these parameters behave like "reactive props" in those frameworks. But, don't worry, Livewire allows you to opt-in to [making your props reactive](/docs/4.x/nesting#reactive-props).

### [#](#passing-route-parameters-as-props "Permalink")Passing route parameters as props

When using components as pages, you can pass route parameters directly to your component. The route parameters are automatically passed to the `mount()` method:

```
Route::livewire('/posts/{id}', 'pages::post.show');


```

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $postId;

 

    public function mount($id)

    {

        $this->postId = $id;

    }

};


```
Livewire also supports Laravel's route model binding:

```
Route::livewire('/posts/{post}', 'pages::post.show');


```

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post; // Automatically bound from route

 

    // No mount() needed - Livewire handles it automatically

};


```


## [#](#page-components "Permalink")Page components

Components can be routed to directly as full pages using `Route::livewire()`. This is one of Livewire's most powerful features, allowing you to build entire pages without traditional controllers.

```
Route::livewire('/posts/create', 'pages::post.create');


```
When a user visits `/posts/create`, Livewire will render the `pages::post.create` component inside your application's layout file.

Page components work just like regular components, but they're rendered as full pages with access to:

- Custom layouts
- Page titles
- Route parameters and model binding
- Named slots for layouts


For complete information about page components, including layouts, titles, and advanced routing, see the [Pages documentation](/docs/4.x/pages).

## [#](#accessing-data-in-views "Permalink")Accessing data in views

Livewire provides several ways to pass data to your component's Blade view. Each approach has different performance and security characteristics.

### [#](#component-properties "Permalink")Component properties

The simplest approach is using public properties, which are automatically available in your Blade template:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = 'My Post';

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $title }}</h1>

</div>


```
Protected properties must be accessed with `$this->`:

```
public $title = 'My Post';           // Available as {{ $title }}

protected $apiKey = 'secret-key';    // Available as {{ $this->apiKey }}


```


Protected properties are not sent to the client

Unlike public properties, protected properties are never sent to the frontend and cannot be manipulated by users. This makes them safe for sensitive data. However, they are not persisted between requests, which limits their usefulness in most Livewire scenarios. They're best used for static values defined in the property declaration that you don't want exposed client-side.

For complete information about properties, including persistence behavior and advanced features, see the [properties documentation](/docs/4.x/properties).

### [#](#computed-properties "Permalink")Computed properties

Computed properties are methods that act like memoized properties. They're perfect for expensive operations like database queries:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

 

#[Computed]

public function posts()

{

    return Post::with('author')->latest()->get();

}


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <article wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">{{ $post->title }}</article>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Notice the `$this->` prefix - this tells Livewire to call the method and cache the result for the current request only (not between requests). For more details, see the [computed properties section](/docs/4.x/properties#computed-properties) in the properties documentation.

### [#](#passing-data-from-render "Permalink")Passing data from render()

Similar to a controller, you can pass data directly to the view using the `render()` method:

```
public function render()

{

    return $this->view([

        'author' => Auth::user(),

        'currentTime' => now(),

    ]);

}


```
Keep in mind that `render()` runs on every component update, so avoid expensive operations here unless you need fresh data on every update.

## [#](#organizing-components "Permalink")Organizing components

While Livewire automatically discovers components in the default `resources/views/components/` directory, you can customize where Livewire looks for components and organize them using namespaces.

### [#](#component-namespaces "Permalink")Component namespaces

Component namespaces allow you to organize components into dedicated directories with a clean reference syntax.

By default, Livewire provides two namespaces:

- `pages::` — Points to `resources/views/pages/`
- `layouts::` — Points to `resources/views/layouts/`


You can define additional namespaces in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'component_namespaces' => [

    'layouts' => resource_path('views/layouts'),

    'pages' => resource_path('views/pages'),

    'admin' => resource_path('views/admin'),    // Custom namespace

    'widgets' => resource_path('views/widgets'), // Another custom namespace

],


```
Then use them when creating, rendering, and routing:

```
php artisan make:livewire admin::users-table


```

```
<livewire:admin::users-table />


```

```
Route::livewire('/admin/users', 'admin::users-table');


```


### [#](#additional-component-locations "Permalink")Additional component locations

If you want Livewire to discover components in additional directories beyond the defaults, you can configure them in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'component_locations' => [

    resource_path('views/components'),

    resource_path('views/admin/components'),

    resource_path('views/widgets'),

],


```
Now Livewire will automatically discover components in all these directories.

### [#](#programmatic-registration "Permalink")Programmatic registration

For more dynamic scenarios (like package development or runtime configuration), you can register components, locations, and namespaces programmatically in a service provider:

**Register an individual component:**

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

// In a service provider's boot() method (e.g., App\Providers\AppServiceProvider)

Livewire::addComponent(

    name: 'custom-button',

    viewPath: resource_path('views/ui/button.blade.php')

);


```
**Register a component directory:**

```
Livewire::addLocation(

    viewPath: resource_path('views/admin/components')

);


```
**Register a namespace:**

```
Livewire::addNamespace(

    namespace: 'ui',

    viewPath: resource_path('views/ui')

);


```
This approach is useful when you need to register components conditionally or when building Laravel packages that provide Livewire components.

#### [#](#registering-class-based-components "Permalink")Registering class-based components

For class-based components, use the same methods but with the `class` parameter instead of `path`:

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

// In a service provider's boot() method (e.g., App\Providers\AppServiceProvider)

 

// Register an individual class-based component

Livewire::addComponent(

    name: 'todos',

    class: \App\Livewire\Todos::class

);

 

// Register a location for class-based components

Livewire::addLocation(

    classNamespace: 'App\\Admin\\Livewire'

);

 

// Create a namespace for class-based components

Livewire::addNamespace(

    namespace: 'admin',

    classNamespace: 'App\\Admin\\Livewire',

    classPath: app_path('Admin/Livewire'),

    classViewPath: resource_path('views/admin/livewire')

);


```


## [#](#class-based-components "Permalink")Class-based components

For teams migrating from Livewire v3 or those who prefer a more traditional Laravel structure, Livewire fully supports class-based components. This approach separates the PHP class and Blade view into different files in their conventional locations.

### [#](#creating-class-based-components "Permalink")Creating class-based components

```
php artisan make:livewire CreatePost --class


```
This creates two separate files:

`app/Livewire/CreatePost.php`

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.create-post');

    }

}


```
`resources/views/livewire/create-post.blade.php`

```
<div>

    {{-- ... --}}

</div>


```


### [#](#when-to-use-class-based-components "Permalink")When to use class-based components

**Use class-based components when:**

- Migrating from Livewire v2/v3
- Your team prefers a more traditional file structure
- You have established conventions around class-based architecture


**Use single-file or multi-file components when:**

- Starting a new Livewire v4 project
- You want better component colocation
- You want to use the latest Livewire conventions


### [#](#configuring-default-component-type "Permalink")Configuring default component type

If you want class-based components by default, configure it in `config/livewire.php`:

```
'make_command' => [

    'type' => 'class',

],


```


## [#](#customizing-component-stubs "Permalink")Customizing component stubs

You can customize the files (or *stubs*) Livewire uses to generate new components by running:

```
php artisan livewire:stubs


```
This creates stub files in your application that you can modify:

**Single-file component stubs:**

- `stubs/livewire-sfc.stub` — Single-file components


**Multi-file component stubs:**

- `stubs/livewire-mfc-class.stub` — PHP class for multi-file components
- `stubs/livewire-mfc-view.stub` — Blade view for multi-file components
- `stubs/livewire-mfc-js.stub` — JavaScript for multi-file components
- `stubs/livewire-mfc-test.stub` — Pest test for multi-file components


**Class-based component stubs:**

- `stubs/livewire.stub` — PHP class for class-based components
- `stubs/livewire.view.stub` — Blade view for class-based components


**Additional stubs:**

- `stubs/livewire.attribute.stub` — Attribute classes
- `stubs/livewire.form.stub` — Form classes


Once published, Livewire will automatically use your custom stubs when generating new components.

## [#](#troubleshooting "Permalink")Troubleshooting

### [#](#component-not-found "Permalink")Component not found

**Symptom:** Error message like "Component [post.create] not found" or "Unable to find component"

**Solutions:**

- Verify the component file exists at the expected path
- Check that the component name in your view matches the file structure (dots for subdirectories)
- For namespaced components, ensure the namespace is defined in `config/livewire.php` or manually registered in a service provider
- Try clearing your view cache: `php artisan view:clear`


### [#](#component-shows-blank-or-doesnt-render "Permalink")Component shows blank or doesn't render

**Common causes:**

- Missing root element in your Blade template (Livewire requires exactly one root element)
- Syntax errors in the PHP section of your component
- Check your Laravel logs for detailed error messages


### [#](#class-name-conflicts "Permalink")Class name conflicts

**Symptom:** Errors about duplicate class names when using single-file components

**Solution:** This can happen if you have multiple single-file components with the same name in different directories. Either:

- Rename one of the components to be unique
- Namespace one of the directories for more clear separation

# Pages

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire components can be used as entire pages by assigning them directly to routes. This allows you to build complete application pages using Livewire components, with additional capabilities like custom layouts, page titles, and route parameters.

## [#](#routing-to-components "Permalink")Routing to components

To route to a component, use the `Route::livewire()` method in your `routes/web.php` file:

```
Route::livewire('/posts/create', 'pages::post.create');


```
When you visit the specified URL, the component will be rendered as a complete page using your application's layout.

## [#](#layouts "Permalink")Layouts

Components rendered via routes will use your application's layout file. By default, Livewire looks for a layout called `layouts::app` located at `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.

You may create this file if it doesn't already exist by running the following command:

```
php artisan livewire:layout


```
This command will generate a file called `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.

Ensure you have created a Blade file at this location and included a `{{ $slot }}` placeholder:

```
<!-- resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php -->

 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        {{ $slot }}

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```
You may customize the default layout by updating the `component_layout` configuration option in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'component_layout' => 'layouts::dashboard',


```


### [#](#component-specific-layouts "Permalink")Component-specific layouts

To use a different layout for a specific component, you may place the `#[Layout]` attribute above your component class:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Layout;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Layout('layouts::dashboard')] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
Alternatively, you may use the `->layout()` method within your component's `render()` method:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    // ...

 

    public function render()

    {

        return $this->view()

            ->layout('layouts::dashboard');

    }

};


```


## [#](#setting-the-page-title "Permalink")Setting the page title

Assigning unique page titles to each page in your application is helpful for both users and search engines.

To set a custom page title for a page component, first, make sure your layout file includes a dynamic title:

```
<head>

    <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

</head>


```
Next, above your Livewire component's class, add the `#[Title]` attribute and pass it your page title:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Title;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Title('Create post')] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
This will set the page title for the component. In this example, the page title will be "Create Post" when the component is rendered.

If you need to pass a dynamic title, such as a title that uses a component property, you can use the `->title()` fluent method in the component's `render()` method:

```
public function render()

{

    return $this->view()

         ->title('Create Post');

}


```


## [#](#setting-additional-layout-file-slots "Permalink")Setting additional layout file slots

If your layout file has any named slots in addition to `$slot`, you can set their content in your Blade view by defining `<x-slot>` outside your root element. For example, if you want to be able to set the page language for each component individually, you can add a dynamic `$lang` slot into the opening HTML tag in your layout file:

```
<!-- resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php -->

 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', $lang ?? app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        {{ $slot }}

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```
Then, in your component view, define an `<x-slot>` element outside the root element:

```
<x-slot:lang>fr</x-slot> // This component is in French

 

<div>

    // French content goes here...

</div>


```


## [#](#accessing-route-parameters "Permalink")Accessing route parameters

When working with page components, you may need to access route parameters within your Livewire component.

To demonstrate, first, define a route with a parameter in your `routes/web.php` file:

```
Route::livewire('/posts/{id}', 'pages::show-post');


```
Here, we've defined a route with an `id` parameter which represents a post's ID.

Next, update your Livewire component to accept the route parameter in the `mount()` method:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount($id)

    {

        $this->post = Post::findOrFail($id);

    }

};


```
In this example, because the parameter name `$id` matches the route parameter `{id}`, if the `/posts/1` URL is visited, Livewire will pass the value of "1" as `$id`.

## [#](#using-route-model-binding "Permalink")Using route model binding

Laravel's route model binding allows you to automatically resolve Eloquent models from route parameters.

After defining a route with a model parameter in your `routes/web.php` file:

```
Route::livewire('/posts/{post}', 'pages::show-post');


```
You can now accept the route model parameter through the `mount()` method of your component:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

    }

};


```
Livewire knows to use "route model binding" because the `Post` type-hint is prepended to the `$post` parameter in `mount()`.

Like before, you can reduce boilerplate by omitting the `mount()` method:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

};


```
The `$post` property will automatically be assigned to the model bound via the route's `{post}` parameter.

# 0006_Properties

# Properties

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Properties store and manage state inside your Livewire components. They are defined as public properties on component classes and can be accessed and modified on both the server and client-side.

## [#](#initializing-properties "Permalink")Initializing properties

You can set initial values for properties within your component's `mount()` method.

Consider the following example:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos = [];

 

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->todos = ['Buy groceries', 'Walk the dog', 'Write code'];

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
In this example, we've defined an empty `todos` array and initialized it with a default list of todos in the `mount()` method. Now, when the component renders for the first time, these initial todos are shown to the user.

## [#](#bulk-assignment "Permalink")Bulk assignment

Sometimes initializing many properties in the `mount()` method can feel verbose. To help with this, Livewire provides a convenient way to assign multiple properties at once via the `fill()` method. By passing an associative array of property names and their respective values, you can set several properties simultaneously and cut down on repetitive lines of code in `mount()`.

For example:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $post;

 

    public $title;

 

    public $description;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

 

        $this->fill(

            $post->only('title', 'description'),

        );

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Because `$post->only(...)` returns an associative array of model attributes and values based on the names you pass into it, the `$title` and `$description` properties will be initially set to the `title` and `description` of the `$post` model from the database without having to set each one individually.

## [#](#data-binding "Permalink")Data binding

Livewire supports two-way data binding through the `wire:model` HTML attribute. This allows you to easily synchronize data between component properties and HTML inputs, keeping your user interface and component state in sync.

Let's use the `wire:model` directive to bind the `$todo` property in a `todos` component to a basic input element:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos = [];

 

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function add()

    {

        $this->todos[] = $this->todo;

 

        $this->todo = '';

    }

 

    // ...

};


```

```
<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="todo" placeholder="Todo...">

 

    <button wire:click="add">Add Todo</button>

 

    <ul>

        @foreach ($todos as $todo)

            <li wire:key="{{ $loop->index }}">{{ $todo }}</li>

        @endforeach

    </ul>

</div>


```
In the above example, the text input's value will synchronize with the `$todo` property on the server when the "Add Todo" button is clicked.

This is just scratching the surface of `wire:model`. For deeper information on data binding, check out our [documentation on forms](/docs/4.x/forms).

## [#](#resetting-properties "Permalink")Resetting properties

Sometimes, you may need to reset your properties back to their initial state after an action is performed by the user. In these cases, Livewire provides a `reset()` method that accepts one or more property names and resets their values to their initial state.

In the example below, we can avoid code duplication by using `$this->reset()` to reset the `todo` field after the "Add Todo" button is clicked:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos = [];

 

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function addTodo()

    {

        $this->todos[] = $this->todo;

 

        $this->reset('todo');

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
In the above example, after a user clicks "Add Todo", the input field holding the todo that has just been added will clear, allowing the user to write a new todo.

`reset()` won't work on values set in `mount()`

`reset()` will reset a property to its state before the `mount()` method was called. If you initialized the property in `mount()` to a different value, you will need to reset the property manually.

## [#](#pulling-properties "Permalink")Pulling properties

Alternatively, you can use the `pull()` method to both reset and retrieve the value in one operation.

Here's the same example from above, but simplified with `pull()`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos = [];

 

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function addTodo()

    {

        $this->todos[] = $this->pull('todo');

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
The above example is pulling a single value, but `pull()` can also be used to reset and retrieve (as a key-value pair) all or some properties:

```
// The same as $this->all() and $this->reset();

$this->pull();

 

// The same as $this->only(...) and $this->reset(...);

$this->pull(['title', 'content']);


```


## [#](#supported-property-types "Permalink")Supported property types

Livewire supports a limited set of property types because of its unique approach to managing component data between server requests.

Each property in a Livewire component is serialized or "dehydrated" into JSON between requests, then "hydrated" from JSON back into PHP for the next request.

This two-way conversion process has certain limitations, restricting the types of properties Livewire can work with.

### [#](#primitive-types "Permalink")Primitive types

Livewire supports primitive types such as strings, integers, etc. These types can be easily converted to and from JSON, making them ideal for use as properties in Livewire components.

Livewire supports the following primitive property types: `Array`, `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `Null`.

```
new class extends Component {

    public array $todos = [];

 

    public string $todo = '';

 

    public int $maxTodos = 10;

 

    public bool $showTodos = false;

 

    public ?string $todoFilter = null;

};


```


### [#](#common-php-types "Permalink")Common PHP types

In addition to primitive types, Livewire supports common PHP object types used in Laravel applications. However, it's important to note that these types will be *dehydrated* into JSON and *hydrated* back to PHP on each request. This means that the property may not preserve run-time values such as closures. Also, information about the object such as class names may be exposed to JavaScript.

Supported PHP types:

| Type | Full Class Name |
| --- | --- |
| BackedEnum | `BackedEnum` |
| Collection | `Illuminate\Support\Collection` |
| Eloquent Collection | `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` |
| Model | `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` |
| DateTime | `DateTime` |
| Carbon | `Carbon\Carbon` |
| Stringable | `Illuminate\Support\Stringable` |


Eloquent Collections and Models

When storing Eloquent Collections and Models in Livewire properties, be aware of these limitations:

- **Query constraints aren't preserved**: Additional query constraints like `select(...)` will not be re-applied on subsequent requests. See [Eloquent constraints aren't preserved between requests](#eloquent-constraints-arent-preserved-between-requests) for details.
- **Performance impact**: Storing large Eloquent collections as properties can cause performance issues because Livewire must re-execute the database query every time the component hydrates. For expensive queries, consider using [computed properties](/docs/4.x/computed-properties) instead, which only execute when the data is actually accessed in your template.

Here's a quick example of setting properties as these various types:

```
public function mount()

{

    $this->todos = collect([]); // Collection

 

    $this->todos = Todos::all(); // Eloquent Collection

 

    $this->todo = Todos::first(); // Model

 

    $this->date = new DateTime('now'); // DateTime

 

    $this->date = new Carbon('now'); // Carbon

 

    $this->todo = str(''); // Stringable

}


```


### [#](#supporting-custom-types "Permalink")Supporting custom types

Livewire allows your application to support custom types through two powerful mechanisms:

- Wireables
- Synthesizers


Wireables are simple and easy to use for most applications, so we'll explore them below. If you're an advanced user or package author wanting more flexibility, [Synthesizers are the way to go](/docs/4.x/synthesizers).

#### [#](#wireables "Permalink")Wireables

Wireables are any class in your application that implements the `Wireable` interface.

For example, let's imagine you have a `Customer` object in your application that contains the primary data about a customer:

```
class Customer

{

    protected $name;

    protected $age;

 

    public function __construct($name, $age)

    {

        $this->name = $name;

        $this->age = $age;

    }

}


```
Attempting to set an instance of this class to a Livewire component property will result in an error telling you that the `Customer` property type isn't supported:

```
new class extends Component {

    public Customer $customer;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->customer = new Customer('Caleb', 29);

    }

};


```
However, you can solve this by implementing the `Wireable` interface and adding a `toLivewire()` and `fromLivewire()` method to your class. These methods tell Livewire how to turn properties of this type into JSON and back again:

```
use Livewire\Wireable;

 

class Customer implements Wireable

{

    protected $name;

    protected $age;

 

    public function __construct($name, $age)

    {

        $this->name = $name;

        $this->age = $age;

    }

 

    public function toLivewire()

    {

        return [

            'name' => $this->name,

            'age' => $this->age,

        ];

    }

 

    public static function fromLivewire($value)

    {

        $name = $value['name'];

        $age = $value['age'];

 

        return new static($name, $age);

    }

}


```
Now you can freely set `Customer` objects on your Livewire components and Livewire will know how to convert these objects into JSON and back into PHP.

As mentioned earlier, if you want to support types more globally and powerfully, Livewire offers Synthesizers, its advanced internal mechanism for handling different property types. [Learn more about Synthesizers](/docs/4.x/synthesizers).

## [#](#accessing-properties-from-javascript "Permalink")Accessing properties from JavaScript

Because Livewire properties are also available in the browser via JavaScript, you can access and manipulate their JavaScript representations from [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/).

Alpine is a lightweight JavaScript library that is included with Livewire. Alpine provides a way to build lightweight interactions into your Livewire components without making full server roundtrips.

Internally, Livewire's frontend is built on top of Alpine. In fact, every Livewire component is actually an Alpine component under-the-hood. This means that you can freely utilize Alpine inside your Livewire components.

The rest of this page assumes a basic familiarity with Alpine. If you're unfamiliar with Alpine, [take a look at the Alpine documentation](https://alpinejs.dev/docs).

### [#](#accessing-properties "Permalink")Accessing properties

Livewire exposes a magic `$wire` object to Alpine. You can access the `$wire` object from any Alpine expression inside your Livewire component.

The `$wire` object can be treated like a JavaScript version of your Livewire component. It has all the same properties and methods as the PHP version of your component, but also contains a few dedicated methods to perform specific functions in your template.

For example, we can use `$wire` to show a live character count of the `todo` input field:

```
<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="todo">

 

    Todo character length: <h2 x-text="$wire.todo.length"></h2>

</div>


```
As the user types in the field, the character length of the current todo being written will be shown and live-updated on the page, all without sending a network request to the server.

### [#](#manipulating-properties "Permalink")Manipulating properties

Similarly, you can manipulate your Livewire component properties in JavaScript using `$wire`.

For example, let's add a "Clear" button to the `todos` component to allow the user to reset the input field using only JavaScript:

```
<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="todo">

 

    <button x-on:click="$wire.todo = ''">Clear</button>

</div>


```
After the user clicks "Clear", the input will be reset to an empty string, without sending a network request to the server.

On the subsequent request, the server-side value of `$todo` will be updated and synchronized.

If you prefer, you can also use the more explicit `.set()` method for setting properties client-side. However, you should note that using `.set()` by default immediately triggers a network request and synchronizes the state with the server. If that is desired, then this is an excellent API:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.set('todo', '')">Clear</button>


```
In order to update the property without sending a network request to the server, you can pass a third bool parameter. This will defer the network request and on a subsequent request, the state will be synchronized on the server-side:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.set('todo', '', false)">Clear</button>


```


## [#](#security-concerns "Permalink")Security concerns

While Livewire properties are a powerful feature, there are a few security considerations that you should be aware of before using them.

In short, always treat public properties as user input — as if they were request input from a traditional endpoint. In light of this, it's essential to validate and authorize properties before persisting them to a database — just like you would do when working with request input in a controller.

### [#](#dont-trust-property-values "Permalink")Don't trust property values

To demonstrate how neglecting to authorize and validate properties can introduce security holes in your application, the following `post.edit` component is vulnerable to attack:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $id;

    public $title;

    public $content;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->id = $post->id;

        $this->title = $post->title;

        $this->content = $post->content;

    }

 

    public function update()

    {

        $post = Post::findOrFail($this->id);

 

        $post->update([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        session()->flash('message', 'Post updated successfully!');

    }

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="update">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    <input type="text" wire:model="content">

 

    <button type="submit">Update</button>

</form>


```
At first glance, this component may look completely fine. But, let's walk through how an attacker could use the component to do unauthorized things in your application.

Because we are storing the `id` of the post as a public property on the component, it can be manipulated on the client just the same as the `title` and `content` properties.

It doesn't matter that we didn't write an input with `wire:model="id"`. A malicious user can easily change the view to the following using their browser DevTools:

```
<form wire:submit="update">

    <input type="text" wire:model="id">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    <input type="text" wire:model="content">

 

    <button type="submit">Update</button>

</form>


```
Now the malicious user can update the `id` input to the ID of a different post model. When the form is submitted and `update()` is called, `Post::findOrFail()` will return and update a post the user is not the owner of.

To prevent this kind of attack, we can use one or both of the following strategies:

- Authorize the input
- Lock the property from updates


#### [#](#authorizing-the-input "Permalink")Authorizing the input

Because `$id` can be manipulated client-side with something like `wire:model`, just like in a controller, we can use [Laravel's authorization](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization) to make sure the current user can update the post:

```
public function update()

{

    $post = Post::findOrFail($this->id);

 

    $this->authorize('update', $post);

 

    $post->update(...);

}


```
If a malicious user mutates the `$id` property, the added authorization will catch it and throw an error.

#### [#](#locking-the-property "Permalink")Locking the property

Livewire also allows you to "lock" properties in order to prevent properties from being modified on the client-side. You can "lock" a property from client-side manipulation using the `#[Locked]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Locked;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Locked]

    public $id;

 

    // ...

};


```
Now, if a user tries to modify `$id` on the front end, an error will be thrown.

By using `#[Locked]`, you can assume this property has not been manipulated anywhere outside your component's class.

For more information on locking properties, [consult the Locked attribute documentation](/docs/4.x/attribute-locked).

#### [#](#eloquent-models-and-locking "Permalink")Eloquent models and locking

When an Eloquent model is assigned to a Livewire component property, Livewire will automatically lock the property and ensure the ID isn't changed, so that you are safe from these kinds of attacks:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

    public $title;

    public $content;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

        $this->title = $post->title;

        $this->content = $post->content;

    }

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->post->update([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        session()->flash('message', 'Post updated successfully!');

    }

};


```


### [#](#properties-expose-system-information-to-the-browser "Permalink")Properties expose system information to the browser

Another essential thing to remember is that Livewire properties are serialized or "dehydrated" before they are sent to the browser. This means that their values are converted to a format that can be sent over the wire and understood by JavaScript. This format can expose information about your application to the browser, including the names and class names of your properties.

For example, suppose you have a Livewire component that defines a public property named `$post`. This property contains an instance of a `Post` model from your database. In this case, the dehydrated value of this property sent over the wire might look something like this:

```
{

    "type": "model",

    "class": "App\Models\Post",

    "key": 1,

    "relationships": []

}


```
As you can see, the dehydrated value of the `$post` property includes the class name of the model (`App\Models\Post`) as well as the ID and any relationships that have been eager-loaded.

If you don't want to expose the class name of the model, you can use Laravel's "morphMap" functionality from a service provider to assign an alias to a model class name:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Providers;

 

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Relation;

 

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider

{

    public function boot()

    {

        Relation::morphMap([

            'post' => 'App\Models\Post',

        ]);

    }

}


```
Now, when the Eloquent model is "dehydrated" (serialized), the original class name won't be exposed, only the "post" alias:

```
 {

     "type": "model",

-    "class": "App\Models\Post",

+    "class": "post",

     "key": 1,

     "relationships": []

 }


```


### [#](#eloquent-constraints-arent-preserved-between-requests "Permalink")Eloquent constraints aren't preserved between requests

Typically, Livewire is able to preserve and recreate server-side properties between requests; however, there are certain scenarios where preserving values are impossible between requests.

For example, when storing Eloquent collections as Livewire properties, additional query constraints like `select(...)` will not be re-applied on subsequent requests.

To demonstrate, consider the following `show-todos` component with a `select()` constraint applied to the `Todos` Eloquent collection:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->todos = Auth::user()

            ->todos()

            ->select(['title', 'content'])

            ->get();

    }

};


```
When this component is initially loaded, the `$todos` property will be set to an Eloquent collection of the user's todos; however, only the `title` and `content` fields of each row in the database will have been queried and loaded into each of the models.

When Livewire *hydrates* the JSON of this property back into PHP on a subsequent request, the select constraint will have been lost.

To ensure the integrity of Eloquent queries, we recommend that you use [computed properties](/docs/4.x/computed-properties) instead of properties.

Computed properties are methods in your component marked with the `#[Computed]` attribute. They can be accessed as a dynamic property that isn't stored as part of the component's state but is instead evaluated on-the-fly.

Here's the above example re-written using a computed property:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()

            ->todos()

            ->select(['title', 'content'])

            ->get();

    }

};


```
Here's how you would access these *todos* from the Blade view:

```
<ul>

    @foreach ($this->todos as $todo)

        <li wire:key="{{ $loop->index }}">{{ $todo }}</li>

    @endforeach

</ul>


```
Notice, inside your views, you can only access computed properties on the `$this` object like so: `$this->todos`.

You can also access `$todos` from inside your class. For example, if you had a `markAllAsComplete()` action:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()

            ->todos()

            ->select(['title', 'content'])

            ->get();

    }

 

    public function markAllComplete()

    {

        $this->todos->each->complete();

    }

};


```
You might wonder why not just call `$this->todos()` as a method directly where you need to? Why use `#[Computed]` in the first place?

The reason is that computed properties have a performance advantage, since they are automatically memoized after their first usage during a single request. This means you can freely access `$this->todos` within your component and be assured that the actual method will only be called once, so that you don't run an expensive query multiple times in the same request.

For more information, [visit the computed properties documentation](/docs/4.x/computed-properties).

# 0007_Actions

# Actions

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire actions are methods on your component that can be triggered by frontend interactions like clicking a button or submitting a form. They provide the developer experience of being able to call a PHP method directly from the browser, allowing you to focus on the logic of your application without getting bogged down writing boilerplate code connecting your application's frontend and backend.

Let's explore a basic example of calling a `save` action:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

};

?>

 

<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

 

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
In the above example, when a user submits the form by clicking "Save", `wire:submit` intercepts the `submit` event and calls the `save()` action on the server.

In essence, actions are a way to easily map user interactions to server-side functionality without the hassle of submitting and handling AJAX requests manually.

## [#](#passing-parameters "Permalink")Passing parameters

Livewire allows you to pass parameters from your Blade template to the actions in your component, giving you the opportunity to provide an action additional data or state from the frontend when the action is called.

For example, let's imagine you have a `ShowPosts` component that allows users to delete a post. You can pass the post's ID as a parameter to the `delete()` action in your Livewire component. Then, the action can fetch the relevant post and delete it from the database:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function delete($id)

    {

        $post = Post::findOrFail($id);

 

        $this->authorize('delete', $post);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

            <span>{{ $post->content }}</span>

 

            <button wire:click="delete({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
For a post with an ID of 2, the "Delete" button in the Blade template above will render in the browser as:

```
<button wire:click="delete(2)">Delete</button>


```
When this button is clicked, the `delete()` method will be called and `$id` will be passed in with a value of "2".

Don't trust action parameters

Action parameters should be treated just like HTTP request input, meaning action parameter values should not be trusted. You should always authorize ownership of an entity before updating it in the database.

For more information, consult our documentation regarding [security concerns and best practices](/docs/4.x/actions#security-concerns).

As an added convenience, you may automatically resolve Eloquent models by a corresponding model ID that is provided to an action as a parameter. This is very similar to [route model binding](/docs/4.x/components#using-route-model-binding). To get started, type-hint an action parameter with a model class and the appropriate model will automatically be retrieved from the database and passed to the action instead of the ID:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function delete(Post $post)

    {

        $this->authorize('delete', $post);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```


## [#](#dependency-injection "Permalink")Dependency injection

You can take advantage of [Laravel's dependency injection](https://laravel.com/docs/controllers#dependency-injection-and-controllers) system by type-hinting parameters in your action's signature. Livewire and Laravel will automatically resolve the action's dependencies from the container:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use App\Repositories\PostRepository;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function delete(PostRepository $posts, $postId)

    {

        $posts->deletePost($postId);

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

            <span>{{ $post->content }}</span>

 

            <button wire:click="delete({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
In this example, the `delete()` method receives an instance of `PostRepository` resolved via [Laravel's service container](https://laravel.com/docs/container#main-content) before receiving the provided `$postId` parameter.

## [#](#event-listeners "Permalink")Event listeners

Livewire supports a variety of event listeners, allowing you to respond to various types of user interactions:

| Listener | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wire:click` | Triggered when an element is clicked |
| `wire:submit` | Triggered when a form is submitted |
| `wire:keydown` | Triggered when a key is pressed down |
| `wire:keyup` | Triggered when a key is released |
| `wire:mouseenter` | Triggered when the mouse enters an element |
| `wire:*` | Whatever text follows `wire:` will be used as the event name of the listener |


Because the event name after `wire:` can be anything, Livewire supports any browser event you might need to listen for. For example, to listen for `transitionend`, you can use `wire:transitionend`.

### [#](#listening-for-specific-keys "Permalink")Listening for specific keys

You can use one of Livewire's convenient aliases to narrow down key press event listeners to a specific key or combination of keys.

For example, to perform a search when a user hits `Enter` after typing into a search box, you can use `wire:keydown.enter`:

```
<input wire:model="query" wire:keydown.enter="searchPosts">


```
You can chain more key aliases after the first to listen for combinations of keys. For example, if you would like to listen for the `Enter` key only while the `Shift` key is pressed, you may write the following:

```
<input wire:keydown.shift.enter="...">


```
Below is a list of all the available key modifiers:

| Modifier | Key |
| --- | --- |
| `.shift` | Shift |
| `.enter` | Enter |
| `.space` | Space |
| `.ctrl` | Ctrl |
| `.cmd` | Cmd |
| `.meta` | Cmd on Mac, Windows key on Windows |
| `.alt` | Alt |
| `.up` | Up arrow |
| `.down` | Down arrow |
| `.left` | Left arrow |
| `.right` | Right arrow |
| `.escape` | Escape |
| `.tab` | Tab |
| `.caps-lock` | Caps Lock |
| `.equal` | Equal, `=` |
| `.period` | Period, `.` |
| `.slash` | Forward Slash, `/` |


### [#](#event-handler-modifiers "Permalink")Event handler modifiers

Livewire also includes helpful modifiers to make common event-handling tasks trivial.

For example, if you need to call `event.preventDefault()` from inside an event listener, you can suffix the event name with `.prevent`:

```
<input wire:keydown.prevent="...">


```
Here is a full list of all the available event listener modifiers and their functions:

| Modifier | Key |
| --- | --- |
| `.prevent` | Equivalent of calling `.preventDefault()` |
| `.stop` | Equivalent of calling `.stopPropagation()` |
| `.window` | Listens for event on the `window` object |
| `.outside` | Only listens for clicks "outside" the element |
| `.document` | Listens for events on the `document` object |
| `.once` | Ensures the listener is only called once |
| `.debounce` | Debounce the handler by 250ms as a default |
| `.debounce.100ms` | Debounce the handler for a specific amount of time |
| `.throttle` | Throttle the handler to being called every 250ms at minimum |
| `.throttle.100ms` | Throttle the handler at a custom duration |
| `.self` | Only call listener if event originated on this element, not children |
| `.camel` | Converts event name to camel case (`wire:custom-event` -> "customEvent") |
| `.dot` | Converts event name to dot notation (`wire:custom-event` -> "custom.event") |
| `.passive` | `wire:touchstart.passive` won't block scroll performance |
| `.capture` | Listen for event in the "capturing" phase |


Because `wire:` uses [Alpine's](https://alpinejs.dev) `x-on` directive under the hood, these modifiers are made available to you by Alpine. For more context on when you should use these modifiers, consult the [Alpine Events documentation](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/events).

### [#](#handling-third-party-events "Permalink")Handling third-party events

Livewire also supports listening for custom events fired by third-party libraries.

For example, let's imagine you're using the [Trix](https://trix-editor.org/) rich text editor in your project and you want to listen for the `trix-change` event to capture the editor's content. You can accomplish this using the `wire:trix-change` directive:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <trix-editor

        wire:trix-change="setPostContent($event.target.value)"

    ></trix-editor>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```
In this example, the `setPostContent` action is called whenever the `trix-change` event is triggered, updating the `content` property in the Livewire component with the current value of the Trix editor.

You can access the event object using`$event`

Within Livewire event handlers, you can access the event object via `$event`. This is useful for referencing information on the event. For example, you can access the element that triggered the event via `$event.target`.

The Trix demo code above is incomplete and only useful as a demonstration of event listeners. If used verbatim, a network request would be fired on every single keystroke. A more performant implementation would be:

```
<trix-editor

   x-on:trix-change="$wire.content = $event.target.value"

></trix-editor>


```

### [#](#listening-for-dispatched-custom-events "Permalink")Listening for dispatched custom events

If your application dispatches custom events from Alpine, you can also listen for those using Livewire:

```
<div wire:custom-event="...">

 

    <!-- Deeply nested within this component: -->

    <button x-on:click="$dispatch('custom-event')">...</button>

 

</div>


```
When the button is clicked in the above example, the `custom-event` event is dispatched and bubbles up to the root of the Livewire component where `wire:custom-event` catches it and invokes a given action.

If you want to listen for an event dispatched somewhere else in your application, you will need to wait instead for the event to bubble up to the `window` object and listen for it there. Fortunately, Livewire makes this easy by allowing you to add a simple `.window` modifier to any event listener:

```
<div wire:custom-event.window="...">

    <!-- ... -->

</div>

 

<!-- Dispatched somewhere on the page outside the component: -->

<button x-on:click="$dispatch('custom-event')">...</button>


```


### [#](#disabling-inputs-while-a-form-is-being-submitted "Permalink")Disabling inputs while a form is being submitted

Consider the `CreatePost` example we previously discussed:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input wire:model="title">

 

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
When a user clicks "Save", a network request is sent to the server to call the `save()` action on the Livewire component.

But, let's imagine that a user is filling out this form on a slow internet connection. The user clicks "Save" and nothing happens initially because the network request takes longer than usual. They might wonder if the submission failed and attempt to click the "Save" button again while the first request is still being handled.

In this case, there would be two requests for the same action being processed at the same time.

To prevent this scenario, Livewire automatically disables the submit button and all form inputs inside the `<form>` element while a `wire:submit` action is being processed. This ensures that a form isn't accidentally submitted twice.

To further lessen the confusion for users on slower connections, it is often helpful to show some loading indicator such as a subtle background color change or SVG animation.

Livewire provides a `wire:loading` directive that makes it trivial to show and hide loading indicators anywhere on a page. Here's a short example of using `wire:loading` to show a loading message below the "Save" button:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

 

    <span wire:loading>Saving...</span>

</form>


```
Alternatively, you can style loading states directly using Tailwind and Livewire's automatic `data-loading` attribute:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit" class="data-loading:opacity-50">Save</button>

 

    <span class="not-data-loading:hidden">Saving...</span>

</form>


```
For most cases, using `data-loading` selectors is simpler and more flexible than `wire:loading`. [Learn more about loading states →](/docs/4.x/loading-states)

## [#](#refreshing-a-component "Permalink")Refreshing a component

Sometimes you may want to trigger a simple "refresh" of your component. For example, if you have a component checking the status of something in the database, you may want to show a button to your users allowing them to refresh the displayed results.

You can do this using Livewire's simple `$refresh` action anywhere you would normally reference your own component method:

```
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">...</button>


```
When the `$refresh` action is triggered, Livewire will make a server-roundtrip and re-render your component without calling any methods.

It's important to note that any pending data updates in your component (for example `wire:model` bindings) will be applied on the server when the component is refreshed.

You can also trigger a component refresh using AlpineJS in your Livewire component:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$refresh()">...</button>


```
Learn more by reading the [documentation for using Alpine inside Livewire](/docs/4.x/alpine).

## [#](#confirming-an-action "Permalink")Confirming an action

When allowing users to perform dangerous actions—such as deleting a post from the database—you may want to show them a confirmation alert to verify that they wish to perform that action.

Livewire makes this easy by providing a simple directive called `wire:confirm`:

```
<button

    type="button"

    wire:click="delete"

    wire:confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this post?"

>

    Delete post

</button>


```
When `wire:confirm` is added to an element containing a Livewire action, when a user tries to trigger that action, they will be presented with a confirmation dialog containing the provided message. They can either press "OK" to confirm the action, or press "Cancel" or hit the escape key.

For more information, visit the [`wire:confirm` documentation page](/docs/4.x/wire-confirm).

## [#](#calling-actions-from-alpine "Permalink")Calling actions from Alpine

Livewire integrates seamlessly with [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/). In fact, under the hood, every Livewire component is also an Alpine component. This means you can take full advantage of Alpine within your components to add JavaScript powered client-side interactivity.

To make this pairing even more powerful, Livewire exposes a magic `$wire` object to Alpine that can be treated as a JavaScript representation of your PHP component. In addition to [accessing and mutating public properties via `$wire`](/docs/4.x/properties#accessing-properties-from-javascript), you can call actions. When an action is invoked on the `$wire` object, the corresponding PHP method will be invoked on your backend Livewire component:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.save()">Save Post</button>


```
Or, to illustrate a more complex example, you might use Alpine's [`x-intersect`](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/intersect) utility to trigger a `incrementViewCount()` Livewire action when a given element is visible on the page:

```
<div x-intersect="$wire.incrementViewCount()">...</div>


```


### [#](#passing-parameters-1 "Permalink")Passing parameters

Any parameters you pass to the `$wire` method will also be passed to the PHP class method. For example, consider the following Livewire action:

```
public function addTodo($todo)

{

    $this->todos[] = $todo;

}


```
Within your component's Blade template, you can invoke this action via Alpine, providing the parameter that should be given to the action:

```
<div x-data="{ todo: '' }">

    <input type="text" x-model="todo">

 

    <button x-on:click="$wire.addTodo(todo)">Add Todo</button>

</div>


```
If a user had typed in "Take out the trash" into the text input and the pressed the "Add Todo" button, the `addTodo()` method will be triggered with the `$todo` parameter value being "Take out the trash".

### [#](#receiving-return-values "Permalink")Receiving return values

For even more power, invoked `$wire` actions return a promise while the network request is processing. When the server response is received, the promise resolves with the value returned by the backend action.

For example, consider a Livewire component that has the following action:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

public function getPostCount()

{

    return Post::count();

}


```
Using `$wire`, the action may be invoked and its returned value resolved:

```
<span x-init="$el.innerHTML = await $wire.getPostCount()"></span>


```
In this example, if the `getPostCount()` method returns "10", the `<span>` tag will also contain "10".

Use #[Json] for JavaScript-consumed actions

For actions primarily consumed by JavaScript, consider using the [`#[Json]` attribute](/docs/4.x/attribute-json). It returns data via promise resolution/rejection, automatically handles validation errors with promise rejection, and skips re-rendering for better performance.

Alpine knowledge is not required when using Livewire; however, it's an extremely powerful tool and knowing Alpine will augment your Livewire experience and productivity.

## [#](#javascript-actions "Permalink")JavaScript actions

Livewire allows you to define JavaScript actions that run entirely on the client-side without making a server request. This is useful in two scenarios:

1. When you want to perform simple UI updates that don't require server communication
2. When you want to optimistically update the UI with JavaScript before making a server request


To define a JavaScript action, you can use the `$js()` function inside a `<script>` tag in your component.

Here's an example of bookmarking a post that uses a JavaScript action to optimistically update the UI before making a server request. The JavaScript action immediately shows the filled bookmark icon, then makes a request to persist the bookmark in the database:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public $bookmarked = false;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->bookmarked = $this->post->bookmarkedBy(auth()->user());

    }

 

    public function bookmarkPost()

    {

        $this->post->bookmark(auth()->user());

 

        $this->bookmarked = $this->post->bookmarkedBy(auth()->user());

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <button wire:click="$js.bookmark" class="flex items-center gap-1">

        {{-- Outlined bookmark icon... --}}

        <svg wire:show="!bookmarked" wire:cloak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" class="size-6">

            <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M17.593 3.322c1.1.128 1.907 1.077 1.907 2.185V21L12 17.25 4.5 21V5.507c0-1.108.806-2.057 1.907-2.185a48.507 48.507 0 0 1 11.186 0Z" />

        </svg>

 

        {{-- Solid bookmark icon... --}}

        <svg wire:show="bookmarked" wire:cloak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" class="size-6">

            <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.32 2.577a49.255 49.255 0 0 1 11.36 0c1.497.174 2.57 1.46 2.57 2.93V21a.75.75 0 0 1-1.085.67L12 18.089l-7.165 3.583A.75.75 0 0 1 3.75 21V5.507c0-1.47 1.073-2.756 2.57-2.93Z" clip-rule="evenodd" />

        </svg>

    </button>

</div>

 

<script>

    this.$js.bookmark = () => {

        $wire.bookmarked = !$wire.bookmarked

 

        $wire.bookmarkPost()

    }

</script>


```
When a user clicks the heart button, the following sequence occurs:

1. The "bookmark" JavaScript action is triggered
2. The heart icon immediately updates by toggling `$wire.bookmarked` on the client-side
3. The `bookmarkPost()` method is called to save the change to the database


This provides instant visual feedback while ensuring the bookmark state is properly persisted.

Class-based components need @script wrapper

The examples above use bare `<script>` tags, which work for single-file and multi-file components. If you're using class-based components, you must wrap your script tags with the `@script` directive:

```
@script

<script>

    this.$js.bookmark = () => { /* ... */ }

</script>

@endscript


```
This ensures your JavaScript is properly scoped to the component.

### [#](#calling-from-alpine "Permalink")Calling from Alpine

You can call JavaScript actions directly from Alpine using the `$wire` object. For example, you may use the `$wire` object to invoke the `bookmark` JavaScript action:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.$js.bookmark()">Bookmark</button>


```


### [#](#calling-from-php "Permalink")Calling from PHP

JavaScript actions can also be called using the `js()` method from PHP:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        // ...

 

        $this->js('onPostSaved');

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button wire:click="save">Save</button>

</div>

 

<script>

    this.$js.onPostSaved = () => {

        alert('Your post has been saved successfully!')

    }

</script>


```
In this example, when the `save()` action is finished, the `postSaved` JavaScript action will be run, triggering the alert dialog.

## [#](#magic-actions "Permalink")Magic actions

Livewire provides a set of "magic" actions that allow you to perform common tasks in your components without defining custom methods. These magic actions can be used within event listeners defined in your Blade templates.

### [#](#parent "Permalink")`$parent`

The `$parent` magic variable allows you to access parent component properties and call parent component actions from a child component:

```
<button wire:click="$parent.removePost({{ $post->id }})">Remove</button>


```
In the above example, if a parent component has a `removePost()` action, a child can call it directly from its Blade template using `$parent.removePost()`.

### [#](#set "Permalink")`$set`

The `$set` magic action allows you to update a property in your Livewire component directly from the Blade template. To use `$set`, provide the property you want to update and the new value as arguments:

```
<button wire:click="$set('query', '')">Reset Search</button>


```
In this example, when the button is clicked, a network request is dispatched that sets the `$query` property in the component to `''`.

### [#](#refresh "Permalink")`$refresh`

The `$refresh` action triggers a re-render of your Livewire component. This can be useful when updating the component's view without changing any property values:

```
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>


```
When the button is clicked, the component will re-render, allowing you to see the latest changes in the view.

### [#](#toggle "Permalink")`$toggle`

The `$toggle` action is used to toggle the value of a boolean property in your Livewire component:

```
<button wire:click="$toggle('sortAsc')">

    Sort {{ $sortAsc ? 'Descending' : 'Ascending' }}

</button>


```
In this example, when the button is clicked, the `$sortAsc` property in the component will toggle between `true` and `false`.

### [#](#dispatch "Permalink")`$dispatch`

The `$dispatch` action allows you to dispatch a Livewire event directly in the browser. Below is an example of a button that, when clicked, will dispatch the `post-deleted` event:

```
<button type="submit" wire:click="$dispatch('post-deleted')">Delete Post</button>


```


### [#](#event "Permalink")`$event`

The `$event` action may be used within event listeners like `wire:click`. This action gives you access to the actual JavaScript event that was triggered, allowing you to reference the triggering element and other relevant information:

```
<input type="text" wire:keydown.enter="search($event.target.value)">


```
When the enter key is pressed while a user is typing in the input above, the contents of the input will be passed as a parameter to the `search()` action.

### [#](#using-magic-actions-from-alpine "Permalink")Using magic actions from Alpine

You can also call magic actions from Alpine using the `$wire` object. For example, you may use the `$wire` object to invoke the `$refresh` magic action:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.$refresh()">Refresh</button>


```


## [#](#skipping-re-renders "Permalink")Skipping re-renders

Sometimes there might be an action in your component with no side effects that would change the rendered Blade template when the action is invoked. If so, you can skip the `render` portion of Livewire's lifecycle by adding the `#[Renderless]` attribute above the action method.

To demonstrate, in the `ShowPost` component below, the "view count" is logged when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the post:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Renderless;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

    }

 

    #[Renderless]

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>

 

    <div wire:intersect="incrementViewCount"></div>

</div>


```
The example above uses `wire:intersect` to call the action when the element enters the viewport (typically used to detect when a user scrolls to an element further down the page).

As you can see, when a user scrolls to the bottom of the post, `incrementViewCount()` is invoked. Since `#[Renderless]` was added to the action, the view is logged, but the template doesn't re-render and no part of the page is affected.

If you prefer to not utilize method attributes or need to conditionally skip rendering, you may invoke the `skipRender()` method in your component action:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

    }

 

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

 

        $this->skipRender();

    }

};


```
You can also skip render from an element directly using the `.renderless` modifier:

```
<button type="button" wire:click.renderless="incrementViewCount">


```


## [#](#parallel-execution-with-async "Permalink")Parallel execution with async

By default, Livewire serializes actions within the same component to ensure predictable state updates. If one action is in-flight, subsequent actions are queued and wait for it to finish. While this prevents race conditions and keeps your component's state consistent, there are times when you want actions to run immediately without waiting—in parallel rather than sequentially.

The `#[Async]` attribute and `wire:click.async` modifier tell Livewire to execute an action in parallel, bypassing the normal request queue.

### [#](#using-the-async-modifier "Permalink")Using the async modifier

You can make any action async by adding the `.async` modifier to your event listener:

```
<button wire:click.async="logActivity">Track Event</button>


```
When this button is clicked, the `logActivity` action will fire immediately, even if other requests are in-flight. It won't block subsequent requests, and other requests won't block it.

### [#](#using-the-async-attribute "Permalink")Using the Async attribute

Alternatively, you can mark a method as async using the `#[Async]` attribute. This makes the action async regardless of where it's called from:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Async]

    public function logActivity()

    {

        Activity::log('post-viewed', $this->post);

    }

 

    // ...

};


```

```
<div wire:intersect="logActivity">

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
In this example, when the element enters the viewport, `logActivity()` is called asynchronously without blocking any other in-flight requests.

### [#](#when-to-use-async-actions "Permalink")When to use async actions

Async actions are useful for fire-and-forget operations where the result doesn't affect what's displayed on the page. Common use cases include:

- **Analytics and logging:** Tracking user behavior, page views, or interactions
- **Background operations:** Triggering jobs, sending notifications, or updating external services
- **JavaScript-only results:** Fetching data via `await $wire.getData()` that will be consumed purely by JavaScript


Here's an example of tracking when a user clicks on an external link:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $url;

 

    #[Async]

    public function trackClick()

    {

        Analytics::track('external-link-clicked', [

            'url' => $this->url,

            'user_id' => auth()->id(),

        ]);

    }

 

    // ...

};


```

```
<a href="{{ $url }}" target="_blank" wire:click.async="trackClick">

    Visit External Site

</a>


```
Because the tracking happens asynchronously, the user's click isn't delayed by the network request.

### [#](#when-not-to-use-async-actions "Permalink")When NOT to use async actions

Async actions and state mutations don't mix

**Never use async actions if they modify component state that's reflected in your UI.** Because async actions run in parallel, you can end up with unpredictable race conditions where your component's state diverges across multiple simultaneous requests.

Consider this dangerous example:

```
// Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do...

 

<?php // resources/views/components/⚡counter.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 0;

 

    #[Async] // Don't do this!

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++; // State mutation in an async action

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
If a user rapidly clicks the increment button, multiple async requests will fire simultaneously. Each request starts with the same initial `$count` value, leading to lost updates. You might click 5 times but only see the counter increment by 1.

**The rule of thumb:** Only use async for actions that perform pure side effects—operations that don't change any properties that affect your component's view.

### [#](#fetching-data-for-javascript "Permalink")Fetching data for JavaScript

Another valid use case is fetching data from the server that will be consumed entirely by JavaScript, without affecting your component's rendered state:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Async]

    public function fetchSuggestions($query)

    {

        return Post::where('title', 'like', "%{$query}%")

            ->limit(5)

            ->pluck('title');

    }

 

    // ...

};


```

```
<div x-data="{ suggestions: [] }">

    <input

        type="text"

        x-on:input.debounce="suggestions = await $wire.fetchSuggestions($event.target.value)"

    >

 

    <template x-for="suggestion in suggestions">

        <div x-text="suggestion"></div>

    </template>

</div>


```
Because the suggestions are stored purely in Alpine's `suggestions` data and never in Livewire's component state, it's safe to fetch them asynchronously.

## [#](#preserving-scroll-position "Permalink")Preserving scroll position

When updating content, the browser may jump to a different scroll position. The `.preserve-scroll` modifier maintains the current scroll position during updates:

```
<button wire:click.preserve-scroll="loadMore">Load More</button>

 

<select wire:model.live.preserve-scroll="category">...</select>


```
This is useful for infinite scroll, filters, and dynamic content updates where you don't want the page to jump.

## [#](#security-concerns "Permalink")Security concerns

Remember that any public method in your Livewire component can be called from the client-side, even without an associated `wire:click` handler that invokes it. In these scenarios, users can still trigger the action from the browser's DevTools.

Below are three examples of easy-to-miss vulnerabilities in Livewire components. Each will show the vulnerable component first and the secure component after. As an exercise, try spotting the vulnerabilities in the first example before viewing the solution.

If you are having difficulty spotting the vulnerabilities and that makes you concerned about your ability to keep your own applications secure, remember all these vulnerabilities apply to standard web applications that use requests and controllers. If you use a component method as a proxy for a controller method, and its parameters as a proxy for request input, you should be able to apply your existing application security knowledge to your Livewire code.

### [#](#always-authorize-action-parameters "Permalink")Always authorize action parameters

Just like controller request input, it's imperative to authorize action parameters since they are arbitrary user input.

Below is a `ShowPosts` component where users can view all their posts on one page. They can delete any post they like using one of the post's "Delete" buttons.

Here is a vulnerable version of the component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function delete($id)

    {

        $post = Post::find($id);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

            <span>{{ $post->content }}</span>

 

            <button wire:click="delete({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Remember that a malicious user can call `delete()` directly from a JavaScript console, passing any parameters they would like to the action. This means that a user viewing one of their posts can delete another user's post by passing the un-owned post ID to `delete()`.

To protect against this, we need to authorize that the user owns the post about to be deleted:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function delete($id)

    {

        $post = Post::find($id);

 

        $this->authorize('delete', $post);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```


### [#](#always-authorize-server-side "Permalink")Always authorize server-side

Like standard Laravel controllers, Livewire actions can be called by any user, even if there isn't an affordance for invoking the action in the UI.

Consider the following `BrowsePosts` component where any user can view all the posts in the application, but only administrators can delete a post:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function deletePost($id)

    {

        $post = Post::find($id);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

            <span>{{ $post->content }}</span>

 

            @if (Auth::user()->isAdmin())

                <button wire:click="deletePost({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>

            @endif

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
As you can see, only administrators can see the "Delete" button; however, any user can call `deletePost()` on the component from the browser's DevTools.

To patch this vulnerability, we need to authorize the action on the server like so:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function deletePost($id)

    {

        if (! Auth::user()->isAdmin) {

            abort(403);

        }

 

        $post = Post::find($id);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```
With this change, only administrators can delete a post from this component.

### [#](#keep-dangerous-methods-protected-or-private "Permalink")Keep dangerous methods protected or private

Every public method inside your Livewire component is callable from the client. Even methods you haven't referenced inside a `wire:click` handler. To prevent a user from calling a method that isn't intended to be callable client-side, you should mark them as `protected` or `private`. By doing so, you restrict the visibility of that sensitive method to the component's class and its subclasses, ensuring they cannot be called from the client-side.

Consider the `BrowsePosts` example that we previously discussed, where users can view all posts in your application, but only administrators can delete posts. In the [Always authorize server-side](/docs/4.x/actions#always-authorize-server-side) section, we made the action secure by adding server-side authorization. Now imagine we refactor the actual deletion of the post into a dedicated method like you might do in order to simplify your code:

```
// Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do...

<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function deletePost($id)

    {

        if (! Auth::user()->isAdmin) {

            abort(403);

        }

 

        $this->delete($id);

    }

 

    public function delete($postId)

    {

        $post = Post::find($postId);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

            <span>{{ $post->content }}</span>

 

            <button wire:click="deletePost({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
As you can see, we refactored the post deletion logic into a dedicated method named `delete()`. Even though this method isn't referenced anywhere in our template, if a user gained knowledge of its existence, they would be able to call it from the browser's DevTools because it is `public`.

To remedy this, we can mark the method as `protected` or `private`. Once the method is marked as `protected` or `private`, an error will be thrown if a user tries to invoke it:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function deletePost($id)

    {

        if (! Auth::user()->isAdmin) {

            abort(403);

        }

 

        $this->delete($id);

    }

 

    protected function delete($postId)

    {

        $post = Post::find($postId);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

};


```

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Because forms are the backbone of most web applications, Livewire provides loads of helpful utilities for building them. From handling simple input elements to complex things like real-time validation or file uploading, Livewire has simple, well-documented tools to make your life easier and delight your users.

Let's dive in.

## [#](#submitting-a-form "Permalink")Submitting a form

Let's start by looking at a very simple form in a `post.create` component. This form will have two simple text inputs and a submit button, as well as some code on the backend to manage the form's state and submission:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create(

            $this->only(['title', 'content'])

        );

 

        session()->flash('status', 'Post successfully updated.');

 

        return $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};

?>

 

<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

 

    <input type="text" wire:model="content">

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
As you can see, we are "binding" the public `$title` and `$content` properties in the form above using `wire:model`. This is one of the most commonly used and powerful features of Livewire.

In addition to binding `$title` and `$content`, we are using `wire:submit` to capture the `submit` event when the "Save" button is clicked and invoking the `save()` action. This action will persist the form input to the database.

After the new post is created in the database, we redirect the user to the posts page and show them a "flash" message that the new post was created.

### [#](#adding-validation "Permalink")Adding validation

To avoid storing incomplete or dangerous user input, most forms need some sort of input validation.

Livewire makes validating your forms as simple as adding `#[Validate]` attributes above the properties you want to be validated.

Once a property has a `#[Validate]` attribute attached to it, the validation rule will be applied to the property's value any time it's updated server-side.

Let's add some basic validation rules to the `$title` and `$content` properties in our `post.create` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate('required')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create(

            $this->only(['title', 'content'])

        );

 

        return $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```
We'll also modify our Blade template to show any validation errors on the page.

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    <div>

        @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <input type="text" wire:model="content">

    <div>

        @error('content') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
Now, if the user tries to submit the form without filling in any of the fields, they will see validation messages telling them which fields are required before saving the post.

Livewire has a lot more validation features to offer. For more information, visit our [dedicated documentation page on Validation](/docs/4.x/validation).

### [#](#extracting-a-form-object "Permalink")Extracting a form object

If you are working with a large form and prefer to extract all of its properties, validation logic, etc., into a separate class, Livewire offers form objects.

Form objects allow you to re-use form logic across components and provide a nice way to keep your component class cleaner by grouping all form-related code into a separate class.

You can either create a form class by hand or use the convenient artisan command:

```
php artisan livewire:form PostForm


```
The above command will create a file called `app/Livewire/Forms/PostForm.php`.

Let's rewrite the `post.create` component to use a `PostForm` class:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $content = '';

}


```

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use App\Livewire\Forms\PostForm;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public PostForm $form;

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create(

            $this->form->only(['title', 'content'])

        );

 

        return $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="form.title">

    <div>

        @error('form.title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <input type="text" wire:model="form.content">

    <div>

        @error('form.content') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
If you'd like, you can also extract the post creation logic into the form object like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function store()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create($this->only(['title', 'content']));

    }

}


```
Now you can call `$this->form->store()` from the component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use App\Livewire\Forms\PostForm;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public PostForm $form;

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->form->store();

 

        return $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
If you want to use this form object for both a create and update form, you can easily adapt it to handle both use cases.

Here's what it would look like to use this same form object for a `post.edit` component and fill it with initial data:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use App\Livewire\Forms\PostForm;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public PostForm $form;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->form->setPost($post);

    }

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->form->update();

 

        return $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Form;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    public ?Post $post;

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function setPost(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

 

        $this->title = $post->title;

 

        $this->content = $post->content;

    }

 

    public function store()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create($this->only(['title', 'content']));

    }

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        $this->post->update(

            $this->only(['title', 'content'])

        );

    }

}


```
As you can see, we've added a `setPost()` method to the `PostForm` object to optionally allow for filling the form with existing data as well as storing the post on the form object for later use. We've also added an `update()` method for updating the existing post.

Form objects are not required when working with Livewire, but they do offer a nice abstraction for keeping your components free of repetitive boilerplate.

### [#](#resetting-form-fields "Permalink")Resetting form fields

If you are using a form object, you may want to reset the form after it has been submitted. This can be done by calling the `reset()` method:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $content = '';

 

    // ...

 

    public function store()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create($this->only(['title', 'content']));

 

        $this->reset();

    }

}


```
You can also reset specific properties by passing the property names into the `reset()` method:

```
$this->reset('title');

 

// Or multiple at once...

 

$this->reset(['title', 'content']);


```


### [#](#pulling-form-fields "Permalink")Pulling form fields

Alternatively, you can use the `pull()` method to both retrieve a form's properties and reset them in one operation.

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $content = '';

 

    // ...

 

    public function store()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create(

            $this->pull()

        );

    }

}


```
You can also pull specific properties by passing the property names into the `pull()` method:

```
// Return a value before resetting...

$this->pull('title');

 

 // Return a key-value array of properties before resetting...

$this->pull(['title', 'content']);


```


### [#](#using-rule-objects "Permalink")Using Rule objects

If you have more sophisticated validation scenarios where Laravel's `Rule` objects are necessary, you can alternatively define a `rules()` method to declare your validation rules like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Illuminate\Validation\Rule;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    public ?Post $post;

 

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    protected function rules()

    {

        return [

            'title' => [

                'required',

                Rule::unique('posts')->ignore($this->post),

            ],

            'content' => 'required|min:5',

        ];

    }

 

    // ...

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        $this->post->update($this->only(['title', 'content']));

 

        $this->reset();

    }

}


```
When using a `rules()` method instead of `#[Validate]`, Livewire will only run the validation rules when you call `$this->validate()`, rather than every time a property is updated.

If you are using real-time validation or any other scenario where you'd like Livewire to validate specific fields after every request, you can use `#[Validate]` without any provided rules like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Illuminate\Validation\Rule;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    public ?Post $post;

 

    #[Validate]

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    protected function rules()

    {

        return [

            'title' => [

                'required',

                Rule::unique('posts')->ignore($this->post),

            ],

            'content' => 'required|min:5',

        ];

    }

 

    // ...

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        $this->post->update($this->only(['title', 'content']));

 

        $this->reset();

    }

}


```
Now if the `$title` property is updated before the form is submitted—like when using [`wire:model.live.blur`](/docs/4.x/wire-model#updating-on-blur-event)—the validation for `$title` will be run.

### [#](#showing-a-loading-indicator "Permalink")Showing a loading indicator

By default, Livewire will automatically disable submit buttons and mark inputs as `readonly` while a form is being submitted, preventing the user from submitting the form again while the first submission is being handled.

However, it can be difficult for users to detect this "loading" state without extra affordances in your application's UI.

Here's an example of adding a small loading spinner to the "Save" button via `wire:loading` so that a user understands that the form is being submitted:

```
<button type="submit">

    Save

 

    <div wire:loading>

        <svg>...</svg> <!-- SVG loading spinner -->

    </div>

</button>


```
Alternatively, you can use Tailwind and Livewire's automatic `data-loading` attribute for cleaner markup:

```
<button type="submit">

    <span class="in-data-loading:hidden">Save</span>

    <span class="not-in-data-loading:hidden">

        <svg>...</svg> <!-- SVG loading spinner -->

    </span>

</button>


```
[Learn more about loading states →](/docs/4.x/loading-states)

## [#](#live-updating-fields "Permalink")Live-updating fields

By default, Livewire only sends a network request when the form is submitted (or any other [action](/docs/4.x/actions) is called), not while the form is being filled out.

Take the `post.create` component, for example. If you want to make sure the "title" input field is synchronized with the `$title` property on the backend as the user types, you may add the `.live` modifier to `wire:model` like so:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live="title">


```
Now, as a user types into this field, network requests will be sent to the server to update `$title`. This is useful for things like a real-time search, where a dataset is filtered as a user types into a search box.

## [#](#only-updating-fields-on-blur "Permalink")Only updating fields on *blur*

For most cases, `wire:model.live` is fine for real-time form field updating; however, it can be overly network resource-intensive on text inputs.

If instead of sending network requests as a user types, you want to instead only send the request when a user "tabs" out of the text input (also referred to as "blurring" an input), you can use the `.blur` modifier instead:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title" >


```
Now the component class on the server won't be updated until the user presses tab or clicks away from the text input.

## [#](#real-time-validation "Permalink")Real-time validation

Sometimes, you may want to show validation errors as the user fills out the form. This way, they are alerted early that something is wrong instead of having to wait until the entire form is filled out.

Livewire handles this sort of thing automatically. By using `.live` or `.blur` on `wire:model`, Livewire will send network requests as the user fills out the form. Each of those network requests will run the appropriate validation rules before updating each property. If validation fails, the property won't be updated on the server and a validation message will be shown to the user:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title">

 

<div>

    @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

</div>


```

```
#[Validate('required|min:5')]

public $title = '';


```
Now, if the user only types three characters into the "title" input, then clicks on the next input in the form, a validation message will be shown to them indicating there is a five character minimum for that field.

For more information, check out the [validation documentation page](/docs/4.x/validation).

## [#](#real-time-form-saving "Permalink")Real-time form saving

If you want to automatically save a form as the user fills it out rather than wait until the user clicks "submit", you can do so using Livewire's `updated()` hook:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Validate('required')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

        $this->title = $post->title;

        $this->content = $post->content;

    }

 

    public function updated($name, $value)

    {

        $this->post->update([

            $name => $value,

        ]);

    }

};

?>

 

<form wire:submit>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title">

    <div>

        @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="content">

    <div>

        @error('content') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

</form>


```
In the above example, when a user completes a field (by clicking or tabbing to the next field), a network request is sent to update that property on the component. Immediately after the property is updated on the class, the `updated()` hook is called for that specific property name and its new value.

We can use this hook to update only that specific field in the database.

Additionally, because we have the `#[Validate]` attributes attached to those properties, the validation rules will be run before the property is updated and the `updated()` hook is called.

To learn more about the "updated" lifecycle hook and other hooks, [visit the lifecycle hooks documentation](/docs/4.x/lifecycle-hooks).

## [#](#showing-dirty-indicators "Permalink")Showing dirty indicators

In the real-time saving scenario discussed above, it may be helpful to indicate to users when a field hasn't been persisted to the database yet.

For example, if a user visits a `post.edit` page and starts modifying the title of the post in a text input, it may be unclear to them when the title is actually being updated in the database, especially if there is no "Save" button at the bottom of the form.

Livewire provides the `wire:dirty` directive to allow you to toggle elements or modify classes when an input's value diverges from the server-side component:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title" wire:dirty.class="border-yellow">


```
In the above example, when a user types into the input field, a yellow border will appear around the field. When the user tabs away, the network request is sent and the border will disappear; signaling to them that the input has been persisted and is no longer "dirty".

If you want to toggle an entire element's visibility, you can do so by using `wire:dirty` in conjunction with `wire:target`. `wire:target` is used to specify which piece of data you want to watch for "dirtiness". In this case, the "title" field:

```
<input type="text" wire:model="title">

 

<div wire:dirty wire:target="title">Unsaved...</div>


```


## [#](#debouncing-input "Permalink")Debouncing input

When using `.live` on a text input, you may want more fine-grained control over how often a network request is sent. By default, a debounce of "250ms" is applied to the input; however, you can customize this using the `.debounce` modifier:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.debounce.150ms="title" >


```
Now that `.debounce.150ms` has been added to the field, a shorter debounce of "150ms" will be used when handling input updates for this field. In other words, as a user types, a network request will only be sent if the user stops typing for at least 150 milliseconds.

## [#](#throttling-input "Permalink")Throttling input

As stated previously, when an input debounce is applied to a field, a network request will not be sent until the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time. This means if the user continues typing a long message, a network request won't be sent until the user is finished.

Sometimes this isn't the desired behavior, and you would rather send a request as the user types, not when they've finished or taken a break.

In these cases, you can instead use `.throttle` to signify a time interval to send network requests:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.throttle.150ms="title" >


```
In the above example, as a user is typing continuously in the "title" field, a network request will be sent every 150 milliseconds until the user is finished.

## [#](#extracting-input-fields-to-blade-components "Permalink")Extracting input fields to Blade components

Even in a small component such as the `post.create` example we've been discussing, we end up duplicating lots of form field boilerplate like validation messages and labels.

It can be helpful to extract repetitive UI elements such as these into dedicated [Blade components](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components) to be shared across your application.

For example, below is the original Blade template from the `post.create` component. We will be extracting the following two text inputs into dedicated Blade components:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    <div>

        @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <input type="text" wire:model="content">

    <div>

        @error('content') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    </div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
Here's what the template will look like after extracting a re-usable Blade component called `<x-input-text>`:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <x-input-text name="title" wire:model="title" />

 

    <x-input-text name="content" wire:model="content" />

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
Next, here's the source for the `x-input-text` component:

```
<!-- resources/views/components/input-text.blade.php -->

 

@props(['name'])

 

<input type="text" name="{{ $name }}" {{ $attributes }}>

 

<div>

    @error($name) <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

</div>


```
As you can see, we took the repetitive HTML and placed it inside a dedicated Blade component.

For the most part, the Blade component contains only the extracted HTML from the original component. However, we have added two things:

- The `@props` directive
- The `{{ $attributes }}` statement on the input


Let's discuss each of these additions:

By specifying `name` as a "prop" using `@props(['name'])` we are telling Blade: if an attribute called "name" is set on this component, take its value and make it available inside this component as `$name`.

For other attributes that don't have an explicit purpose, we used the `{{ $attributes }}` statement. This is used for "attribute forwarding", or in other words, taking any HTML attributes written on the Blade component and forwarding them onto an element within the component.

This ensures `wire:model="title"` and any other extra attributes such as `disabled`, `class="..."`, or `required` still get forwarded to the actual `<input>` element.

### [#](#custom-form-controls "Permalink")Custom form controls

In the previous example, we "wrapped" an input element into a re-usable Blade component we can use as if it was a native HTML input element.

This pattern is very useful; however, there might be some cases where you want to create an entire input component from scratch (without an underlying native input element), but still be able to bind its value to Livewire properties using `wire:model`.

For example, let's imagine you wanted to create an `<x-input-counter />` component that was a simple "counter" input written in Alpine.

Before we create a Blade component, let's first look at a simple, pure-Alpine, "counter" component for reference:

```
<div x-data="{ count: 0 }">

    <button x-on:click="count--">-</button>

 

    <span x-text="count"></span>

 

    <button x-on:click="count++">+</button>

</div>


```
As you can see, the component above shows a number alongside two buttons to increment and decrement that number.

Now, let's imagine we want to extract this component into a Blade component called `<x-input-counter />` that we would use within a component like so:

```
<x-input-counter wire:model="quantity" />


```
Creating this component is mostly simple. We take the HTML of the counter and place it inside a Blade component template like `resources/views/components/input-counter.blade.php`.

However, making it work with `wire:model="quantity"` so that you can easily bind data from your Livewire component to the "count" inside this Alpine component needs one extra step.

Here's the source for the component:

```
<!-- resources/view/components/input-counter.blade.php -->

 

<div x-data="{ count: 0 }" x-modelable="count" {{ $attributes}}>

    <button x-on:click="count--">-</button>

 

    <span x-text="count"></span>

 

    <button x-on:click="count++">+</button>

</div>


```
As you can see, the only different bit about this HTML is the `x-modelable="count"` and `{{ $attributes }}`.

`x-modelable` is a utility in Alpine that tells Alpine to make a certain piece of data available for binding from outside. [The Alpine documentation has more information on this directive.](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/modelable)

`{{ $attributes }}`, as we explored earlier, forwards any attributes passed into the Blade component from outside. In this case, the `wire:model` directive will be forwarded.

Because of `{{ $attributes }}`, when the HTML is rendered in the browser, `wire:model="quantity"` will be rendered alongside `x-modelable="count"` on the root `<div>` of the Alpine component like so:

```
<div x-data="{ count: 0 }" x-modelable="count" wire:model="quantity">


```
`x-modelable="count"` tells Alpine to look for any `x-model` or `wire:model` statements and use "count" as the data to bind them to.

Because `x-modelable` works for both `wire:model` and `x-model`, you can also use this Blade component interchangeably with Livewire and Alpine. Here’s an example of using this Blade component in a purely Alpine context:

```
<x-input-counter x-model="quantity" />


```
Creating custom input elements in your application is extremely powerful but requires a deeper understanding of the utilities Livewire and Alpine provide and how they interact with each other.

# Events

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire offers a robust event system that you can use to communicate between different components on the page. Because it uses browser events under the hood, you can also use Livewire's event system to communicate with Alpine components or even plain, vanilla JavaScript.

To trigger an event, you may use the `dispatch()` method from anywhere inside your component and listen for that event from any other component on the page.

## [#](#dispatching-events "Permalink")Dispatching events

To dispatch an event from a Livewire component, you can call the `dispatch()` method, passing it the event name and any additional data you want to send along with the event.

Below is an example of dispatching a `post-created` event from a `post.create` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function save()

    {

        // ...

 

        $this->dispatch('post-created');

    }

};


```
In this example, when the `dispatch()` method is called, the `post-created` event will be dispatched, and every other component on the page that is listening for this event will be notified.

You can pass additional data with the event by passing the data as the second parameter to the `dispatch()` method:

```
$this->dispatch('post-created', title: $post->title);


```


## [#](#listening-for-events "Permalink")Listening for events

To listen for an event in a Livewire component, add the `#[On]` attribute above the method you want to be called when a given event is dispatched:

Make sure you import attribute classes

Make sure you import any attribute classes. For example, the below `#[On()]` attributes requires the following import `use Livewire\Attributes\On;`.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[On('post-created')]

    public function updatePostList($title)

    {

        // ...

    }

};


```
Now, when the `post-created` event is dispatched from `post.create`, a network request will be triggered and the `updatePostList()` action will be invoked.

As you can see, additional data sent with the event will be provided to the action as its first argument.

### [#](#listening-for-dynamic-event-names "Permalink")Listening for dynamic event names

Occasionally, you may want to dynamically generate event listener names at run-time using data from your component.

For example, if you wanted to scope an event listener to a specific Eloquent model, you could append the model's ID to the event name when dispatching like so:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function update()

    {

        // ...

 

        $this->dispatch("post-updated.{$post->id}");

    }

};


```
And then listen for that specific model:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[On('post-updated.{post.id}')]

    public function refreshPost()

    {

        // ...

    }

};


```
If the above `$post` model had an ID of `3`, the `refreshPost()` method would only be triggered by an event named: `post-updated.3`.

### [#](#listening-for-events-from-specific-child-components "Permalink")Listening for events from specific child components

Livewire allows you to listen for events directly on individual child components in your Blade template like so:

```
<div>

    <livewire:edit-post @saved="$refresh">

 

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
In the above scenario, if the `edit-post` child component dispatches a `saved` event, the parent's `$refresh` will be called and the parent will be refreshed.

Instead of passing `$refresh`, you can pass any method you normally would to something like `wire:click`. Here's an example of calling a `close()` method that might do something like close a modal dialog:

```
<livewire:edit-post @saved="close">


```
If the child dispatched parameters along with the request, for example `$this->dispatch('saved', postId: 1)`, you can forward those values to the parent method using the following syntax:

```
<livewire:edit-post @saved="close($event.detail.postId)">


```


## [#](#using-javascript-to-interact-with-events "Permalink")Using JavaScript to interact with events

Livewire's event system becomes much more powerful when you interact with it from JavaScript inside your application. This unlocks the ability for any other JavaScript in your app to communicate with Livewire components on the page.

### [#](#listening-for-events-inside-component-scripts "Permalink")Listening for events inside component scripts

You can easily listen for the `post-created` event inside your component's template from a `<script>` tag like so:

```
<script>

    this.$on('post-created', () => {

        //

    });

</script>


```
The above snippet would listen for the `post-created` from the component it's registered within. If the component is no longer on the page, the event listener will no longer be triggered.

[Read more about using JavaScript inside your Livewire components →](/docs/4.x/javascript#using-javascript-in-livewire-components)

### [#](#dispatching-events-from-component-scripts "Permalink")Dispatching events from component scripts

Additionally, you can dispatch events from within a component's `<script>` tag like so:

```
<script>

    this.$dispatch('post-created');

</script>


```
When the above script is run, the `post-created` event will be dispatched to the component it's defined within.

To dispatch the event only to the component where the script resides and not other components on the page (preventing the event from "bubbling" up), you can use `dispatchSelf()`:

```
this.$dispatchSelf('post-created');


```
You can pass any additional parameters to the event by passing an object as a second argument to `dispatch()`:

```
<script>

    this.$dispatch('post-created', { refreshPosts: true });

</script>


```
You can now access those event parameters from both your Livewire class and also other JavaScript event listeners.

Here's an example of receiving the `refreshPosts` parameter within a Livewire class:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\On;

 

// ...

 

#[On('post-created')]

public function handleNewPost($refreshPosts = false)

{

    //

}


```
You can also access the `refreshPosts` parameter from a JavaScript event listener from the event's `detail` property:

```
<script>

    this.$on('post-created', (event) => {

        let refreshPosts = event.detail.refreshPosts

 

        // ...

    });

</script>


```
[Read more about using JavaScript inside your Livewire components →](/docs/4.x/javascript#using-javascript-in-livewire-components)

### [#](#listening-for-livewire-events-from-global-javascript "Permalink")Listening for Livewire events from global JavaScript

Alternatively, you can listen for Livewire events globally using `Livewire.on` from any script in your application:

```
<script>

    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {

       Livewire.on('post-created', (event) => {

           //

       });

    });

</script>


```
The above snippet would listen for the `post-created` event dispatched from any component on the page.

If you wish to remove this event listener for any reason, you can do so using the returned `cleanup` function:

```
<script>

    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {

        let cleanup = Livewire.on('post-created', (event) => {

            //

        });

 

        // Calling "cleanup()" will un-register the above event listener...

        cleanup();

    });

</script>


```


## [#](#events-in-alpine "Permalink")Events in Alpine

Because Livewire events are plain browser events under the hood, you can use Alpine to listen for them or even dispatch them.

### [#](#listening-for-livewire-events-in-alpine "Permalink")Listening for Livewire events in Alpine

For example, we may easily listen for the `post-created` event using Alpine:

```
<div x-on:post-created="..."></div>


```
The above snippet would listen for the `post-created` event from any Livewire components that are children of the HTML element that the `x-on` directive is assigned to.

To listen for the event from any Livewire component on the page, you can add `.window` to the listener:

```
<div x-on:post-created.window="..."></div>


```
If you want to access additional data that was sent with the event, you can do so using `$event.detail`:

```
<div x-on:post-created="notify('New post: ' + $event.detail.title)"></div>


```
The Alpine documentation provides further information on [listening for events](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/on).

### [#](#dispatching-livewire-events-from-alpine "Permalink")Dispatching Livewire events from Alpine

Any event dispatched from Alpine is capable of being intercepted by a Livewire component.

For example, we may easily dispatch the `post-created` event from Alpine:

```
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('post-created')">...</button>


```
Like Livewire's `dispatch()` method, you can pass additional data along with the event by passing the data as the second parameter to the method:

```
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('post-created', { title: 'Post Title' })">...</button>


```
To learn more about dispatching events using Alpine, consult the [Alpine documentation](https://alpinejs.dev/magics/dispatch).

You might not need events

If you are using events to call behavior on a parent from a child, you can instead call the action directly from the child using `$parent` in your Blade template. For example:

```
<button wire:click="$parent.showCreatePostForm()">Create Post</button>


```
[Learn more about $parent](/docs/4.x/nesting#directly-accessing-the-parent-from-the-child).

## [#](#dispatching-directly-to-another-component "Permalink")Dispatching directly to another component

If you want to use events for communicating directly between two components on the page, you can use the `dispatch()->to()` modifier.

Below is an example of the `post.create` component dispatching the `post-created` event directly to the `dashboard` component, skipping any other components listening for that specific event:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function save()

    {

        // ...

 

        $this->dispatch('post-created')->to(component: Dashboard::class);

    }

};


```


## [#](#dispatching-a-component-event-to-itself "Permalink")Dispatching a component event to itself

Using the `dispatch()->self()` modifier, you can restrict an event to only being intercepted by the component it was triggered from:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function save()

    {

        // ...

 

        $this->dispatch('post-created')->to(self: true);

    }

};


```


## [#](#dispatching-events-from-blade-templates "Permalink")Dispatching events from Blade templates

You can dispatch events directly from your Blade templates using the `$dispatch` JavaScript function. This is useful when you want to trigger an event from a user interaction, such as a button click:

```
<button wire:click="$dispatch('show-post-modal', { id: {{ $post->id }} })">

    EditPost

</button>


```
In this example, when the button is clicked, the `show-post-modal` event will be dispatched with the specified data.

If you want to dispatch an event directly to another component you can use the `$dispatchTo()` JavaScript function:

```
<button wire:click="$dispatchTo('posts', 'show-post-modal', { id: {{ $post->id }} })">

    EditPost

</button>


```
In this example, when the button is clicked, the `show-post-modal` event will be dispatched directly to the `Posts` component.

## [#](#testing-dispatched-events "Permalink")Testing dispatched events

To test events dispatched by your component, use the `assertDispatched()` method in your Livewire test. This method checks that a specific event has been dispatched during the component's lifecycle:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature;

 

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

use App\Livewire\CreatePost;

use Livewire\Livewire;

 

class CreatePostTest extends TestCase

{

    use RefreshDatabase;

 

    public function test_it_dispatches_post_created_event()

    {

        Livewire::test(CreatePost::class)

            ->call('save')

            ->assertDispatched('post-created');

    }

}


```
In this example, the test ensures that the `post-created` event is dispatched with the specified data when the `save()` method is called on the `post.create` component.

### [#](#testing-event-listeners "Permalink")Testing Event Listeners

To test event listeners, you can dispatch events from the test environment and assert that the expected actions are performed in response to the event:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature;

 

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

use App\Livewire\Dashboard;

use Livewire\Livewire;

 

class DashboardTest extends TestCase

{

    use RefreshDatabase;

 

    public function test_it_updates_post_count_when_a_post_is_created()

    {

        Livewire::test(Dashboard::class)

            ->assertSee('Posts created: 0')

            ->dispatch('post-created')

            ->assertSee('Posts created: 1');

    }

}


```
In this example, the test dispatches the `post-created` event, then checks that the `dashboard` component properly handles the event and displays the updated count.

## [#](#real-time-events-using-laravel-echo "Permalink")Real-time events using Laravel Echo

Livewire pairs nicely with [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation) to provide real-time functionality on your web-pages using WebSockets.

Installing Laravel Echo is a prerequisite

This feature assumes you have installed Laravel Echo and the `window.Echo` object is globally available in your application. For more information on installing echo, check out the [Laravel Echo documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation).

### [#](#listening-for-echo-events "Permalink")Listening for Echo events

Imagine you have an event in your Laravel application named `OrderShipped`:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Events;

 

use App\Models\Order;

use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;

use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

 

class OrderShipped implements ShouldBroadcast

{

    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

 

    public Order $order;

 

    public function broadcastOn()

    {

        return new Channel('orders');

    }

}


```
You might dispatch this event from another part of your application like so:

```
use App\Events\OrderShipped;

 

OrderShipped::dispatch();


```
If you were to listen for this event in JavaScript using only Laravel Echo, it would look something like this:

```
Echo.channel('orders')

    .listen('OrderShipped', e => {

        console.log(e.order)

    })


```
Assuming you have Laravel Echo installed and configured, you can listen for this event from inside a Livewire component.

Below is an example of an `order-tracker` component that is listening for the `OrderShipped` event in order to show users a visual indication of a new order:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $showNewOrderNotification = false;

 

    #[On('echo:orders,OrderShipped')]

    public function notifyNewOrder()

    {

        $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
If you have Echo channels with variables embedded in them (such as an Order ID), you can define listeners via the `getListeners()` method instead of the `#[On]` attribute:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Order;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Order $order;

 

    public $showOrderShippedNotification = false;

 

    public function getListeners()

    {

        return [

            "echo:orders.{$this->order->id},OrderShipped" => 'notifyShipped',

        ];

    }

 

    public function notifyShipped()

    {

        $this->showOrderShippedNotification = true;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Or, if you prefer, you can use the dynamic event name syntax:

```
#[On('echo:orders.{order.id},OrderShipped')]

public function notifyNewOrder()

{

    $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;

}


```
If you need to access the event payload, you can do so via the passed in `$event` parameter:

```
#[On('echo:orders.{order.id},OrderShipped')]

public function notifyNewOrder($event)

{

    $order = Order::find($event['orderId']);

 

    //

}


```


### [#](#customizing-broadcast-event-names-with-broadcastas "Permalink")Customizing broadcast event names with `broadcastAs()`

By default, Laravel broadcasts events using the event class name. However, you can customize the broadcast event name by implementing the `broadcastAs()` method in your event class.

For example, if you have a `ScoreSubmitted` event but want to broadcast it as `score.submitted`:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Events;

 

use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;

use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

 

class ScoreSubmitted implements ShouldBroadcast

{

    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

 

    public function broadcastOn()

    {

        return new Channel('scores');

    }

 

    public function broadcastAs(): string

    {

        return 'score.submitted';

    }

}


```
When listening for this event in a Livewire component, you should use the custom broadcast name returned by `broadcastAs()` instead of the class name. **Important:** When using a custom broadcast name, you must prefix it with a dot (`.`) to distinguish it from namespaced event class names. This is a [Laravel Echo convention](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#broadcast-name):

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ScoreBoard extends Component

{

    public $scores = [];

 

    #[On('echo:scores,.score.submitted')]

    public function handleScoreSubmitted($event)

    {

        $this->scores[] = $event['score'];

    }

}


```
In the above example, the Livewire component listens for `.score.submitted` (the custom broadcast name prefixed with a dot) rather than `ScoreSubmitted` (the class name). The dot prefix tells Laravel Echo not to prepend the application's namespace (`App\Events`) to the event name.

You can also use the custom broadcast name with dynamic channel names:

```
#[On('echo:scores.{game.id},.score.submitted')]

public function handleScoreSubmitted($event)

{

    $this->scores[] = $event['score'];

}


```


### [#](#private--presence-channels "Permalink")Private & presence channels

You may also listen to events broadcast to private and presence channels:

Before proceeding, ensure you have defined [Authentication Callbacks](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting#defining-authorization-callbacks) for your broadcast channels.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡order-tracker.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $showNewOrderNotification = false;

 

    public function getListeners()

    {

        return [

            // Public Channel

            "echo:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',

 

            // Private Channel

            "echo-private:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',

 

            // Presence Channel

            "echo-presence:orders,OrderShipped" => 'notifyNewOrder',

            "echo-presence:orders,here" => 'notifyNewOrder',

            "echo-presence:orders,joining" => 'notifyNewOrder',

            "echo-presence:orders,leaving" => 'notifyNewOrder',

        ];

    }

 

    public function notifyNewOrder()

    {

        $this->showNewOrderNotification = true;

    }

};


```

# 0010_Lifecycle Hooks

# Lifecycle Hooks

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire provides a variety of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute code at specific points during a component's lifecycle. These hooks enable you to perform actions before or after particular events, such as initializing the component, updating properties, or rendering the template.

Here's a list of all the available component lifecycle hooks:

| Hook Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mount()` | Called when a component is created |
| `hydrate()` | Called when a component is re-hydrated at the beginning of a subsequent request |
| `boot()` | Called at the beginning of every request. Both initial, and subsequent |
| `updating()` | Called before updating a component property |
| `updated()` | Called after updating a property |
| `rendering()` | Called before `render()` is called |
| `rendered()` | Called after `render()` is called |
| `dehydrate()` | Called at the end of every component request |
| `exception($e, $stopPropagation)` | Called when an exception is thrown |


## [#](#mount "Permalink")Mount

In a standard PHP class, a constructor (`__construct()`) takes in outside parameters and initializes the object's state. However, in Livewire, you use the `mount()` method for accepting parameters and initializing the state of your component.

Livewire components don't use `__construct()` because Livewire components are *re-constructed* on subsequent network requests, and we only want to initialize the component once when it is first created.

Here's an example of using the `mount()` method to initialize the `name` and `email` properties of a `profile.edit` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/profile/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $name;

 

    public $email;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->name = Auth::user()->name;

 

        $this->email = Auth::user()->email;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
As mentioned earlier, the `mount()` method receives data passed into the component as method parameters:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title;

 

    public $content;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->title = $post->title;

 

        $this->content = $post->content;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```


You can use dependency injection with all hook methods

Livewire allows you to resolve dependencies out of [Laravel's service container](https://laravel.com/docs/container#automatic-injection) by type-hinting method parameters on lifecycle hooks.

The `mount()` method is a crucial part of using Livewire. The following documentation provides further examples of using the `mount()` method to accomplish common tasks:

- [Initializing properties](/docs/4.x/properties#initializing-properties)
- [Receiving data from parent components](/docs/4.x/nesting#passing-props-to-children)
- [Accessing route parameters](/docs/4.x/pages#accessing-route-parameters)


## [#](#boot "Permalink")Boot

As helpful as `mount()` is, it only runs once per component lifecycle, and you may want to run logic at the beginning of every single request to the server for a given component.

For these cases, Livewire provides a `boot()` method where you can write component setup code that you intend to run every single time the component class is booted: both on initialization and on subsequent requests.

The `boot()` method can be useful for things like initializing protected properties, which are not persisted between requests. Below is an example of initializing a protected property as an Eloquent model:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Locked;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Locked]

    public $postId = 1;

 

    protected Post $post;

 

    public function boot()

    {

        $this->post = Post::find($this->postId);

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
You can use this technique to have complete control over initializing a component property in your Livewire component.

Most of the time, you can use a computed property instead

The technique used above is powerful; however, it's often better to use [Livewire's computed properties](/docs/4.x/computed-properties) to solve this use case.

Always lock sensitive public properties

As you can see above, we are using the `#[Locked]` attribute on the `$postId` property. In a scenario like the above, where you want to ensure the `$postId` property isn't tampered with by users on the client-side, it's important to authorize the property's value before using it or add `#[Locked]` to the property ensure it is never changed.

For more information, check out the [documentation on the Locked attribute](/docs/4.x/attribute-locked).

## [#](#update "Permalink")Update

Client-side users can update public properties in many different ways, most commonly by modifying an input with `wire:model` on it.

Livewire provides convenient hooks to intercept the updating of a public property so that you can validate or authorize a value before it's set, or ensure a property is set in a given format.

Below is an example of using `updating` to prevent the modification of the `$postId` property.

It's worth noting that for this particular example, in an actual application, you should use the [`#[Locked]` attribute](/docs/4.x/attribute-locked) instead, like in the above example.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Exception;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $postId = 1;

 

    public function updating($property, $value)

    {

        // $property: The name of the current property being updated

        // $value: The value about to be set to the property

 

        if ($property === 'postId') {

            throw new Exception;

        }

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
The above `updating()` method runs before the property is updated, allowing you to catch invalid input and prevent the property from updating. Below is an example of using `updated()` to ensure a property's value stays consistent:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $username = '';

 

    public $email = '';

 

    public function updated($property)

    {

        // $property: The name of the current property that was updated

 

        if ($property === 'username') {

            $this->username = strtolower($this->username);

        }

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Now, anytime the `$username` property is updated client-side, we will ensure that the value will always be lowercase.

Because you are often targeting a specific property when using update hooks, Livewire allows you to specify the property name directly as part of the method name. Here's the same example from above but rewritten utilizing this technique:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $username = '';

 

    public $email = '';

 

    public function updatedUsername()

    {

        $this->username = strtolower($this->username);

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Of course, you can also apply this technique to the `updating` hook.

### [#](#arrays "Permalink")Arrays

Array properties have an additional `$key` argument passed to these functions to specify the changing element.

Note that when the array itself is updated instead of a specific key, the `$key` argument is null.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/preferences/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $preferences = [];

 

    public function updatedPreferences($value, $key)

    {

        // $value = 'dark'

        // $key   = 'theme'

    }

 

    // ...

};


```


## [#](#hydrate--dehydrate "Permalink")Hydrate & Dehydrate

Hydrate and dehydrate are lesser-known and lesser-utilized hooks. However, there are specific scenarios where they can be powerful.

The terms "dehydrate" and "hydrate" refer to a Livewire component being serialized to JSON for the client-side and then unserialized back into a PHP object on the subsequent request.

We often use the terms "hydrate" and "dehydrate" to refer to this process throughout Livewire's codebase and the documentation. If you'd like more clarity on these terms, you can learn more by [consulting our hydration documentation](/docs/4.x/hydration).

Let's look at an example that uses both `mount()` , `hydrate()`, and `dehydrate()` all together to support using a custom [data transfer object (DTO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) instead of an Eloquent model to store the post data in the component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $post;

 

    public function mount($title, $content)

    {

        // Runs at the beginning of the first initial request...

 

        $this->post = new PostDto([

            'title' => $title,

            'content' => $content,

        ]);

    }

 

    public function hydrate()

    {

        // Runs at the beginning of every "subsequent" request...

        // This doesn't run on the initial request ("mount" does)...

 

        $this->post = new PostDto($this->post);

    }

 

    public function dehydrate()

    {

        // Runs at the end of every single request...

 

        $this->post = $this->post->toArray();

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Now, from actions and other places inside your component, you can access the `PostDto` object instead of the primitive data.

The above example mainly demonstrates the abilities and nature of the `hydrate()` and `dehydrate()` hooks. However, it is recommended that you use [Wireables or Synthesizers](/docs/4.x/properties#supporting-custom-types) to accomplish this instead.

## [#](#render "Permalink")Render

If you want to hook into the process of rendering a component's Blade view, you can do so using the `rendering()` and `rendered()` hooks:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function render()

    {

        return $this->view([

            'post' => Post::all(),

        ]);

    }

 

    public function rendering($view, $data)

    {

        // Runs BEFORE the provided view is rendered...

        //

        // $view: The view about to be rendered

        // $data: The data provided to the view

    }

 

    public function rendered($view, $html)

    {

        // Runs AFTER the provided view is rendered...

        //

        // $view: The rendered view

        // $html: The final, rendered HTML

    }

 

    // ...

};


```


## [#](#exception "Permalink")Exception

Sometimes it can be helpful to intercept and catch errors, eg: to customize the error message or ignore specific type of exceptions. The `exception()` hook allows you to do just that: you can perform check on the `$error`, and use the `$stopPropagation` parameter to catch the issue.
This also unlocks powerful patterns when you want to stop further execution of code (return early), this is how internal methods like `validate()` works.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->post = Post::find($this->postId);

    }

 

    public function exception($e, $stopPropagation) {

        if ($e instanceof NotFoundException) {

            $this->notify('Post is not found');

            $stopPropagation();

        }

    }

 

    // ...

};


```


## [#](#using-hooks-inside-a-trait "Permalink")Using hooks inside a trait

Traits are a helpful way to reuse code across components or extract code from a single component into a dedicated file.

To avoid multiple traits conflicting with each other when declaring lifecycle hook methods, Livewire supports prefixing hook methods with the *camelCased* name of the current trait declaring them.

This way, you can have multiple traits using the same lifecycle hooks and avoid conflicting method definitions.

Below is an example of a component referencing a trait called `HasPostForm`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    use HasPostForm;

 

    // ...

};


```
Now here's the actual `HasPostForm` trait containing all the available prefixed hooks:

```
trait HasPostForm

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function mountHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function hydrateHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function bootHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatingHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatedHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function renderingHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function renderedHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function dehydrateHasPostForm()

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


## [#](#using-hooks-inside-a-form-object "Permalink")Using hooks inside a form object

Form objects in Livewire support property update hooks. These hooks work similarly to [component update hooks](#update), letting you perform actions when properties in the form object change.

Below is an example of a component using a `PostForm` form object:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public PostForm $form;

 

    // ...

};


```
Here's the `PostForm` form object containing all the available hooks:

```
namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $tags = [];

 

    public function updating($property, $value)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updated($property, $value)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatingTitle($value)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatedTitle($value)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatingTags($value, $key)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    public function updatedTags($value, $key)

    {

        // ...

    }

 

    // ...

}


```

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to nest additional Livewire components inside of a parent component. This feature is immensely powerful, as it allows you to re-use and encapsulate behavior within Livewire components that are shared across your application.

You might not need a Livewire component

Before you extract a portion of your template into a nested Livewire component, ask yourself: Does this content in this component need to be "live"? If not, we recommend that you create a simple [Blade component](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components) instead. Only create a Livewire component if the component benefits from Livewire's dynamic nature or if there is a direct performance benefit.

Consider islands for isolated updates

If you want to isolate re-rendering to specific regions of your component without the overhead of creating separate child components, consider using [islands](/docs/4.x/islands) instead. Islands let you create independently-updating regions within a single component without managing props, events, or child component communication.

Consult our [in-depth, technical examination of Livewire component nesting](/docs/4.x/understanding-nesting) for more information on the performance, usage implications, and constraints of nested Livewire components.

## [#](#nesting-a-component "Permalink")Nesting a component

To nest a Livewire component within a parent component, simply include it in the parent component's Blade view. Below is an example of a `dashboard` parent component that contains a nested `todos` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    //

};

?>

 

<div>

    <h1>Dashboard</h1>

 

    <livewire:todos />

</div>


```
On this page's initial render, the `dashboard` component will encounter `<livewire:todos />` and render it in place. On a subsequent network request to `dashboard`, the nested `todos` component will skip rendering because it is now its own independent component on the page. For more information on the technical concepts behind nesting and rendering, consult our documentation on why [nested components are independent](/docs/4.x/understanding-nesting#every-component-is-an-island).

For more information about the syntax for rendering components, consult our documentation on [Rendering Components](/docs/4.x/components#rendering-components).

## [#](#passing-props-to-children "Permalink")Passing props to children

Passing data from a parent component to a child component is straightforward. In fact, it's very much like passing props to a typical [Blade component](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#components).

For example, let's check out a `todos` component that passes a collection of `$todos` to a child component called `todo-count`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()->todos,

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <livewire:todo-count :todos="$this->todos" />

 

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
As you can see, we are passing `$this->todos` into `todo-count` with the syntax: `:todos="$this->todos"`.

Now that `$todos` has been passed to the child component, you can receive that data through the child component's `mount()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos;

 

    public function mount($todos)

    {

        $this->todos = $todos;

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function count()

    {

        return $this->todos->count(),

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Count: {{ $this->count }}

</div>


```


Omit`mount()` as a shorter alternative

If the `mount()` method in above example feels like redundant boilerplate code to you, it can be omitted as long as the property and parameter names match:

```
public $todos;


```

### [#](#passing-static-props "Permalink")Passing static props

In the previous example, we passed props to our child component using Livewire's dynamic prop syntax, which supports PHP expressions like so:

```
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" />


```
However, sometimes you may want to pass a component a simple static value such as a string. In these cases, you may omit the colon from the beginning of the statement:

```
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" label="Todo Count:" />


```
Boolean values may be provided to components by only specifying the key. For example, to pass an `$inline` variable with a value of `true` to a component, we may simply place `inline` on the component tag:

```
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" inline />


```


### [#](#shortened-attribute-syntax "Permalink")Shortened attribute syntax

When passing PHP variables into a component, the variable name and the prop name are often the same. To avoid writing the name twice, Livewire allows you to simply prefix the variable with a colon:

```
-<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" />

  

+<livewire:todo-count :$todos />


```


## [#](#rendering-children-in-a-loop "Permalink")Rendering children in a loop

When rendering a child component within a loop, you should include a unique `key` value for each iteration.

Component keys are how Livewire tracks each component on subsequent renders, particularly if a component has already been rendered or if multiple components have been re-arranged on the page.

You can specify the component's key by specifying a `:key` prop on the child component:

```
<div>

    <h1>Todos</h1>

 

    @foreach ($todos as $todo)

        <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />

    @endforeach

</div>


```
As you can see, each child component will have a unique key set to the ID of each `$todo`. This ensures the key will be unique and tracked if the todos are re-ordered.

Keys aren't optional

If you have used frontend frameworks like Vue or Alpine, you are familiar with adding a key to a nested element in a loop. However, in those frameworks, a key isn't *mandatory*, meaning the items will render, but a re-order might not be tracked properly. However, Livewire relies more heavily on keys and will behave incorrectly without them.

## [#](#reactive-props "Permalink")Reactive props

Developers new to Livewire expect that props are "reactive" by default. In other words, they expect that when a parent changes the value of a prop being passed into a child component, the child component will automatically be updated. However, by default, Livewire props are not reactive.

When using Livewire, [every component is independent](/docs/4.x/understanding-nesting#every-component-is-an-island). This means that when an update is triggered on the parent and a network request is dispatched, only the parent component's state is sent to the server to re-render - not the child component's. The intention behind this behavior is to only send the minimal amount of data back and forth between the server and client, making updates as performant as possible.

But, if you want or need a prop to be reactive, you can easily enable this behavior using the `#[Reactive]` attribute parameter.

For example, below is the template of a parent `todos` component. Inside, it is rendering a `todo-count` component and passing in the current list of todos:

```
<div>

    <h1>Todos:</h1>

 

    <livewire:todo-count :$todos />

 

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
Now let's add `#[Reactive]` to the `$todos` prop in the `todo-count` component. Once we have done so, any todos that are added or removed inside the parent component will automatically trigger an update within the `todo-count` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Reactive;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Reactive]

    public $todos;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function count()

    {

        return $this->todos->count(),

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Count: {{ $this->count }}

</div>


```
Reactive properties are an incredibly powerful feature, making Livewire more similar to frontend component libraries like Vue and React. But, it is important to understand the performance implications of this feature and only add `#[Reactive]` when it makes sense for your particular scenario.

Islands can eliminate the need for reactive props

If you find yourself creating child components primarily to isolate updates and using `#[Reactive]` to keep them in sync, consider using [islands](/docs/4.x/islands) instead. Islands provide isolated re-rendering within a single component without the need for reactive props or child component communication.

## [#](#binding-to-child-data-using-wiremodel "Permalink")Binding to child data using `wire:model`

Another powerful pattern for sharing state between parent and child components is using `wire:model` directly on a child component via Livewire's `Modelable` feature.

This behavior is very commonly needed when extracting an input element into a dedicated Livewire component while still accessing its state in the parent component.

Below is an example of a parent `todos` component that contains a `$todo` property which tracks the current todo about to be added by a user:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function add()

    {

        Todo::create([

            'content' => $this->pull('todo'),

        ]);

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()->todos,

    }

};


```
As you can see in the `todos` template, `wire:model` is being used to bind the `$todo` property directly to a nested `todo-input` component:

```
<div>

    <h1>Todos</h1>

 

    <livewire:todo-input wire:model="todo" />

 

    <button wire:click="add">Add Todo</button>

 

    <div>

        @foreach ($this->todos as $todo)

            <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />

        @endforeach

    </div>

</div>


```
Livewire provides a `#[Modelable]` attribute you can add to any child component property to make it *modelable* from a parent component.

Below is the `todo-input` component with the `#[Modelable]` attribute added above the `$value` property to signal to Livewire that if `wire:model` is declared on the component by a parent it should bind to this property:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-input.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Modelable]

    public $value = '';

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="value" >

</div>


```
Now the parent `todos` component can treat `todo-input` like any other input element and bind directly to its value using `wire:model`.

Currently Livewire only supports a single `#[Modelable]` attribute, so only the first one will be bound.

## [#](#slots "Permalink")Slots

Slots allow you to pass Blade content from a parent component into a child component. This is useful when a child component needs to render its own content while also allowing the parent to inject custom content in specific places.

Below is an example of a parent component that renders a list of comments. Each comment is rendered by a `Comment` child component, but the parent passes in a "Remove" button via a slot:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function comments()

    {

        return $this->post->comments;

    }

 

    public function removeComment($id)

    {

        $this->post->comments()->find($id)->delete();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @foreach ($this->comments as $comment)

        <livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id">

            <button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})">

                Remove

            </button>

        </livewire:comment>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Now that content has been passed to the `Comment` child component, you can render it using the `$slot` variable:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Comment;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Comment $comment;

};

?>

 

<div>

    <p>{{ $comment->author }}</p>

    <p>{{ $comment->body }}</p>

 

    {{ $slot }}

</div>


```
When the `Comment` component renders `$slot`, Livewire will inject the content passed from the parent.

It's important to understand that slots are evaluated in the context of the parent component. This means any properties or methods referenced inside the slot belong to the parent, not the child. In the example above, the `removeComment()` method is called on the parent component, not the `Comment` child.

### [#](#named-slots "Permalink")Named slots

In addition to the default slot, you may also pass multiple named slots into a child component. This is useful when you want to provide content for multiple areas of a child component.

Below is an example of passing both a default slot and a named `actions` slot to the `Comment` component:

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->comments as $comment)

        <livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id">

            <livewire:slot name="actions">

                <button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})">

                    Remove

                </button>

            </livewire:slot>

 

            <span>Posted on {{ $comment->created_at }}</span>

        </livewire:comment>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
You can access named slots in the child component by passing the slot name to the `$slots` variable:

```
<div>

    <p>{{ $comment->author }}</p>

    <p>{{ $comment->body }}</p>

 

    <div class="actions">

        {{ $slots['actions'] }}

    </div>

 

    <div class="metadata">

        {{ $slot }}

    </div>

</div>


```


### [#](#checking-if-a-slot-was-provided "Permalink")Checking if a slot was provided

You can check if a slot was provided by the parent using the `has()` method on the `$slots` variable. This is helpful when you want to conditionally render content based on whether or not a slot is present:

```
<div>

    <p>{{ $comment->author }}</p>

    <p>{{ $comment->body }}</p>

 

    @if ($slots->has('actions'))

        <div class="actions">

            {{ $slots['actions'] }}

        </div>

    @endif

 

    {{ $slot }}

</div>


```


## [#](#forwarding-html-attributes "Permalink")Forwarding HTML attributes

Like Blade components, Livewire components support forwarding HTML attributes from a parent to a child using the `$attributes` variable.

Below is an example of a parent component passing a `class` attribute to a child component:

```
<livewire:comment :$comment class="border-b" />


```
You can apply these attributes in the child component using the `$attributes` variable:

```
<div {{ $attributes->class('bg-white rounded-md') }}>

    <p>{{ $comment->author }}</p>

    <p>{{ $comment->body }}</p>

</div>


```
Attributes that match public property names are automatically passed as props and excluded from `$attributes`. Any remaining attributes like `class`, `id`, or `data-*` are available through `$attributes`.

## [#](#islands-vs-nested-components "Permalink")Islands vs nested components

When building Livewire applications, you'll often face a choice: Should you create a nested child component or use an island? Both approaches allow you to isolate updates to specific regions, but they serve different purposes.

### [#](#when-to-use-islands "Permalink")When to use islands

Islands are ideal when you want performance isolation without architectural complexity. Use islands when:

**You need performance optimization without the overhead**

If your primary goal is to prevent expensive computations from running unnecessarily, islands are the simpler solution:

```
{{-- Island: Simple performance isolation --}}

@island

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->expensiveRevenue }}

        <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

    </div>

@endisland


```
This achieves the same performance benefit as a child component, but without creating a separate component file, managing props, or setting up event communication.

**You want to defer or lazy load content**

Islands excel at deferring expensive operations until after the initial page load:

```
@island(lazy: true)

    <div>{{ $this->slowApiCall }}</div>

@endisland


```
**You have multiple independent UI regions**

When you have several regions that update independently but don't need separate logic:

```
@island(name: 'stats')

    <div>Stats: {{ $this->stats }}</div>

@endisland

 

@island(name: 'chart')

    <div>Chart: {{ $this->chartData }}</div>

@endisland


```
**The isolated region doesn't need its own lifecycle**

Islands share the parent component's lifecycle, state, and methods. This is perfect when the region is conceptually part of the same component.

### [#](#when-to-use-nested-components "Permalink")When to use nested components

Nested components are better when you need true encapsulation and reusability. Use nested components when:

**You need reusable, self-contained functionality**

If the component will be used in multiple places with its own logic and state:

```
{{-- This todo-item can be reused across the application --}}

<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />


```
**You need separate lifecycle hooks**

When the child needs its own `mount()`, `updated()`, or other lifecycle methods:

```
public function mount($todo)

{

    $this->authorize('view', $todo);

}

 

public function updated($property)

{

    // Child-specific update logic

}


```
**You need encapsulated state and logic**

When the child has complex state management that should be isolated:

```
// Child component with its own encapsulated state

public $editMode = false;

public $draft = '';

 

public function startEdit() { /* ... */ }

public function saveEdit() { /* ... */ }

public function cancelEdit() { /* ... */ }


```
**You need the component to be truly independent**

Nested components are truly independent, maintaining their own state across parent updates. This is valuable when you don't want parent re-renders to affect the child.

**You're building a component library**

When creating reusable components for your team or organization, nested components provide the proper encapsulation boundaries.

### [#](#quick-decision-guide "Permalink")Quick decision guide

Still not sure? Ask yourself:

- **"Does this need to be reusable?"** → Nested component
- **"Does this need its own lifecycle methods?"** → Nested component
- **"Am I just trying to optimize performance?"** → Island
- **"Do I want to defer loading expensive content?"** → Island (with `lazy` or `defer`)
- **"Will this be used in one place only?"** → Probably an island
- **"Does this need complex, isolated state?"** → Nested component


Remember: You can always start with an island for simplicity and refactor to a nested component later if you need the additional encapsulation.

## [#](#listening-for-events-from-children "Permalink")Listening for events from children

Another powerful parent-child component communication technique is Livewire's event system, which allows you to dispatch an event on the server or client that can be intercepted by other components.

Our [complete documentation on Livewire's event system](/docs/4.x/events) provides more detailed information on events, but below we'll discuss a simple example of using an event to trigger an update in a parent component.

Consider a `todos` component with functionality to show and remove todos:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function remove($todoId)

    {

        $todo = Todo::find($todoId);

 

        $this->authorize('delete', $todo);

 

        $todo->delete();

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()->todos,

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @foreach ($this->todos as $todo)

        <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />

    @endforeach

</div>


```
To call `remove()` from inside the child `todo-item` components, you can add an event listener to `todos` via the `#[On]` attribute:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[On('remove-todo')]

    public function remove($todoId)

    {

        $todo = Todo::find($todoId);

 

        $this->authorize('delete', $todo);

 

        $todo->delete();

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function todos()

    {

        return Auth::user()->todos,

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @foreach ($this->todos as $todo)

        <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Once the attribute has been added to the action, you can dispatch the `remove-todo` event from the `todo-item` child component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Todo $todo;

 

    public function remove()

    {

        $this->dispatch('remove-todo', todoId: $this->todo->id);

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <span>{{ $todo->content }}</span>

 

    <button wire:click="remove">Remove</button>

</div>


```
Now when the "Remove" button is clicked inside a `todo-item`, the parent `todos` component will intercept the dispatched event and perform the todo removal.

After the todo is removed in the parent, the list will be re-rendered and the child that dispatched the `remove-todo` event will be removed from the page.

### [#](#improving-performance-by-dispatching-client-side "Permalink")Improving performance by dispatching client-side

Though the above example works, it takes two network requests to perform a single action:

1. The first network request from the `todo-item` component triggers the `remove` action, dispatching the `remove-todo` event.
2. The second network request is after the `remove-todo` event is dispatched client-side and is intercepted by `todos` to call its `remove` action.


You can avoid the first request entirely by dispatching the `remove-todo` event directly on the client-side. Below is an updated `todo-item` component that does not trigger a network request when dispatching the `remove-todo` event:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Todo;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Todo $todo;

};

?>

 

<div>

    <span>{{ $todo->content }}</span>

 

    <button wire:click="$dispatch('remove-todo', { todoId: {{ $todo->id }} })">Remove</button>

</div>


```
As a rule of thumb, always prefer dispatching client-side when possible.

Islands eliminate event communication overhead

If you're creating child components primarily to trigger parent updates via events, consider using [islands](/docs/4.x/islands) instead. Islands can call component methods directly without the indirection of events, since they share the same component context.

## [#](#directly-accessing-the-parent-from-the-child "Permalink")Directly accessing the parent from the child

Event communication adds a layer of indirection. A parent can listen for an event that never gets dispatched from a child, and a child can dispatch an event that is never intercepted by a parent.

This indirection is sometimes desirable; however, in other cases you may prefer to access a parent component directly from the child component.

Livewire allows you to accomplish this by providing a magic `$parent` variable to your Blade template that you can use to access actions and properties directly from the child. Here's the above `TodoItem` template rewritten to call the `remove()` action directly on the parent via the magic `$parent` variable:

```
<div>

    <span>{{ $todo->content }}</span>

 

    <button wire:click="$parent.remove({{ $todo->id }})">Remove</button>

</div>


```
Events and direct parent communication are a few of the ways to communicate back and forth between parent and child components. Understanding their tradeoffs enables you to make more informed decisions about which pattern to use in a particular scenario.

## [#](#dynamic-child-components "Permalink")Dynamic child components

Sometimes, you may not know which child component should be rendered on a page until run-time. Therefore, Livewire allows you to choose a child component at run-time via `<livewire:dynamic-component ...>`, which receives an `:is` prop:

```
<livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" />


```
Dynamic child components are useful in a variety of different scenarios, but below is an example of rendering different steps in a multi-step form using a dynamic component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡steps.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $current = 'step-one';

 

    protected $steps = [

        'step-one',

        'step-two',

        'step-three',

    ];

 

    public function next()

    {

        $currentIndex = array_search($this->current, $this->steps);

 

        $this->current = $this->steps[$currentIndex + 1];

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" :wire:key="$current" />

 

    <button wire:click="next">Next</button>

</div>


```
Now, if the `steps` component's `$current` prop is set to "step-one", Livewire will render a component named "step-one" like so:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡step-one.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    //

};

?>

 

<div>

    Step One Content

</div>


```
If you prefer, you can use the alternative syntax:

```
<livewire:is :component="$current" :wire:key="$current" />


```


Don't forget to assign each child component a unique key. Although Livewire automatically generates a key for `<livewire:dynamic-child />` and `<livewire:is />`, that same key will apply to *all* your child components, meaning subsequent renders will be skipped.

See [forcing a child component to re-render](#forcing-a-child-component-to-re-render) for a deeper understanding of how keys affect component rendering.

## [#](#recursive-components "Permalink")Recursive components

Although rarely needed by most applications, Livewire components may be nested recursively, meaning a parent component renders itself as its child.

Imagine a survey which contains a `survey-question` component that can have sub-questions attached to itself:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡survey-question.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Question;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Question $question;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function subQuestions()

    {

        return $this->question->subQuestions,

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Question: {{ $question->content }}

 

    @foreach ($this->subQuestions as $subQuestion)

        <livewire:survey-question :question="$subQuestion" :wire:key="$subQuestion->id" />

    @endforeach

</div>


```


Of course, the standard rules of recursion apply to recursive components. Most importantly, you should have logic in your template to ensure the template doesn't recurse indefinitely. In the example above, if a `$subQuestion` contained the original question as its own `$subQuestion`, an infinite loop would occur.

## [#](#forcing-a-child-component-to-re-render "Permalink")Forcing a child component to re-render

Behind the scenes, Livewire generates a key for each nested Livewire component in its template.

For example, consider the following nested `todo-count` component:

```
<div>

    <livewire:todo-count :$todos />

</div>


```
Livewire internally attaches a random string key to the component like so:

```
<div>

    <livewire:todo-count :$todos wire:key="lska" />

</div>


```
When the parent component is rendering and encounters a child component like the above, it stores the key in a list of children attached to the parent:

```
'children' => ['lska'],


```
Livewire uses this list for reference on subsequent renders in order to detect if a child component has already been rendered in a previous request. If it has already been rendered, the component is skipped. Remember, [nested components are independent](/docs/4.x/understanding-nesting#every-component-is-an-island). However, if the child key is not in the list, meaning it hasn't been rendered already, Livewire will create a new instance of the component and render it in place.

These nuances are all behind-the-scenes behavior that most users don't need to be aware of; however, the concept of setting a key on a child is a powerful tool for controlling child rendering.

Using this knowledge, if you want to force a component to re-render, you can simply change its key.

Below is an example where we might want to destroy and re-initialize the `todo-count` component if the `$todos` being passed to the component are changed:

```
<div>

    <livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" :wire:key="$todos->pluck('id')->join('-')" />

</div>


```
As you can see above, we are generating a dynamic `:key` string based on the content of `$todos`. This way, the `todo-count` component will render and exist as normal until the `$todos` themselves change. At that point, the component will be re-initialized entirely from scratch, and the old component will be discarded.

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire components are simple to test. Because they are just Laravel classes under the hood, they can be tested using Laravel's existing testing tools. However, Livewire provides many additional utilities to make testing your components a breeze.

This documentation will guide you through testing Livewire components using **Pest** as the recommended testing framework, though you can also use PHPUnit if you prefer.

## [#](#installing-pest "Permalink")Installing Pest

[Pest](https://pestphp.com/) is a delightful PHP testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It's the recommended way to test Livewire components in Livewire 4.

To install Pest in your Laravel application, first remove PHPUnit (if it's installed) and require Pest:

```
composer remove phpunit/phpunit

composer require pestphp/pest --dev --with-all-dependencies


```
Next, initialize Pest in your project:

```
./vendor/bin/pest --init


```
This will create a `tests/Pest.php` configuration file in your project.

For more detailed installation instructions, see the [Pest installation documentation](https://pestphp.com/docs/installation).

## [#](#configuring-pest-for-view-based-components "Permalink")Configuring Pest for view-based components

If you're writing tests alongside your view-based components (single-file or multi-file), you'll need to configure Pest to recognize these test files.

First, update your `tests/Pest.php` file to include the `resources/views` directory:

```
pest()->extend(Tests\TestCase::class)

    // ...

    ->in('Feature', '../resources/views');


```
This tells Pest to use your `TestCase` base class for tests found in both the `tests/Feature` directory and anywhere within `resources/views`.

Next, update your `phpunit.xml` file to include a test suite for component tests:

```
<testsuite name="Components">

    <directory suffix=".test.php">resources/views</directory>

</testsuite>


```
Now Pest will recognize and run tests located next to your components when you run `./vendor/bin/pest`.

## [#](#creating-your-first-test "Permalink")Creating your first test

You can generate a test file alongside a component by appending the `--test` flag to the `make:livewire` command:

```
php artisan make:livewire post.create --test


```
For multi-file components, this will create a test file at `resources/views/components/post/create.test.php`:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Livewire;

 

it('renders successfully', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->assertStatus(200);

});


```
For class-based components, this creates a PHPUnit test file at `tests/Feature/Livewire/Post/CreateTest.php`. You can convert it to Pest syntax or keep using PHPUnit—both work great with Livewire.

### [#](#testing-a-page-contains-a-component "Permalink")Testing a page contains a component

The simplest Livewire test you can write is asserting that a given endpoint includes and successfully renders a Livewire component.

```
it('component exists on the page', function () {

    $this->get('/posts/create')

        ->assertSeeLivewire('post.create');

});


```


Smoke tests provide huge value

Tests like these are called "smoke tests"—they ensure there are no catastrophic problems in your application. Although simple, these tests provide enormous value as they require very little maintenance and give you a base level of confidence that your pages render successfully.

## [#](#browser-testing "Permalink")Browser testing

Pest v4 includes first-party browser testing support powered by Playwright. This allows you to test your Livewire components in a real browser, interacting with them just like a user would.

### [#](#installing-browser-testing "Permalink")Installing browser testing

First, install the Pest browser plugin:

```
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-browser --dev


```
Next, install Playwright via npm:

```
npm install playwright@latest

npx playwright install


```
For complete browser testing documentation, see the [Pest browser testing guide](https://pestphp.com/docs/browser-testing).

### [#](#writing-browser-tests "Permalink")Writing browser tests

Instead of using `Livewire::test()`, you can use `Livewire::visit()` to test your component in a real browser:

```
it('can create a new post', function () {

    Livewire::visit('post.create')

        ->type('[wire\:model="title"]', 'My first post')

        ->type('[wire\:model="content"]', 'This is the content')

        ->press('Save')

        ->assertSee('Post created successfully');

});


```
Browser tests are slower than unit tests but provide end-to-end confidence that your components work as expected in a real browser environment.

For a complete list of available browser testing assertions, see the [Pest browser testing assertions](https://pestphp.com/docs/browser-testing#content-available-assertions).

When to use browser tests

Use browser tests for critical user flows and complex interactions. For most component testing, the standard `Livewire::test()` approach is faster and sufficient.

## [#](#testing-views "Permalink")Testing views

Livewire provides `assertSee()` to verify that text appears in your component's rendered output:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

it('displays posts', function () {

    Post::factory()->create(['title' => 'My first post']);

    Post::factory()->create(['title' => 'My second post']);

 

    Livewire::test('show-posts')

        ->assertSee('My first post')

        ->assertSee('My second post');

});


```


### [#](#asserting-view-data "Permalink")Asserting view data

Sometimes it's helpful to test the data being passed into the view rather than the rendered output:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

it('passes all posts to the view', function () {

    Post::factory()->count(3)->create();

 

    Livewire::test('show-posts')

        ->assertViewHas('posts', function ($posts) {

            return count($posts) === 3;

        });

});


```
For simple assertions, you can pass the expected value directly:

```
Livewire::test('show-posts')

    ->assertViewHas('postCount', 3);


```


## [#](#testing-with-authentication "Permalink")Testing with authentication

Most applications require users to log in. Rather than manually authenticating at the beginning of each test, use the `actingAs()` method:

```
use App\Models\User;

use App\Models\Post;

 

it('user only sees their own posts', function () {

    $user = User::factory()

        ->has(Post::factory()->count(3))

        ->create();

 

    $stranger = User::factory()

        ->has(Post::factory()->count(2))

        ->create();

 

    Livewire::actingAs($user)

        ->test('show-posts')

        ->assertViewHas('posts', function ($posts) {

            return count($posts) === 3;

        });

});


```


## [#](#testing-properties "Permalink")Testing properties

Livewire provides utilities for setting and asserting component properties.

Use `set()` to update properties and `assertSet()` to verify their values:

```
it('can set the title property', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'My amazing post')

        ->assertSet('title', 'My amazing post');

});


```


### [#](#initializing-properties "Permalink")Initializing properties

Components often receive data from parent components or route parameters. Pass this data as the second parameter to `Livewire::test()`:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

it('title field is populated when editing', function () {

    $post = Post::factory()->create([

        'title' => 'Existing post title',

    ]);

 

    Livewire::test('post.edit', ['post' => $post])

        ->assertSet('title', 'Existing post title');

});


```


### [#](#setting-url-parameters "Permalink")Setting URL parameters

If your component uses [Livewire's URL feature](/docs/4.x/url) to track state in query strings, use `withQueryParams()` to simulate URL parameters:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

it('can search posts via url query string', function () {

    Post::factory()->create(['title' => 'Laravel testing']);

    Post::factory()->create(['title' => 'Vue components']);

 

    Livewire::withQueryParams(['search' => 'Laravel'])

        ->test('search-posts')

        ->assertSee('Laravel testing')

        ->assertDontSee('Vue components');

});


```


### [#](#setting-cookies "Permalink")Setting cookies

Use `withCookie()` or `withCookies()` to set cookies for your tests:

```
it('loads discount token from cookie', function () {

    Livewire::withCookies(['discountToken' => 'SUMMER2024'])

        ->test('cart')

        ->assertSet('discountToken', 'SUMMER2024');

});


```


## [#](#calling-actions "Permalink")Calling actions

Use the `call()` method to trigger component actions in your tests:

```
use App\Models\Post;

 

it('can create a post', function () {

    expect(Post::count())->toBe(0);

 

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'My new post')

        ->set('content', 'Post content here')

        ->call('save');

 

    expect(Post::count())->toBe(1);

});


```


Pest expectations

The examples above use Pest's `expect()` syntax for assertions. For a complete list of available expectations, see the [Pest expectations documentation](https://pestphp.com/docs/expectations).

You can pass parameters to actions:

```
Livewire::test('post.show')

    ->call('deletePost', $postId);


```


### [#](#testing-validation "Permalink")Testing validation

Assert that validation errors have been thrown using `assertHasErrors()`:

```
it('title field is required', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', '')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertHasErrors('title');

});


```
Test specific validation rules:

```
it('title must be at least 3 characters', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'ab')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertHasErrors(['title' => ['min:3']]);

});


```


### [#](#testing-authorization "Permalink")Testing authorization

Ensure authorization checks work correctly using `assertUnauthorized()` and `assertForbidden()`:

```
use App\Models\User;

use App\Models\Post;

 

it('cannot update another users post', function () {

    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $stranger = User::factory()->create();

    $post = Post::factory()->for($stranger)->create();

 

    Livewire::actingAs($user)

        ->test('post.edit', ['post' => $post])

        ->set('title', 'Hacked!')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertForbidden();

});


```


### [#](#testing-redirects "Permalink")Testing redirects

Assert that an action performed a redirect:

```
it('redirects to posts index after creating', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'New post')

        ->set('content', 'Content here')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertRedirect('/posts');

});


```
You can also assert redirects to named routes or page components:

```
->assertRedirect(route('posts.index'));

->assertRedirectToRoute('posts.index');


```


### [#](#testing-events "Permalink")Testing events

Assert that events were dispatched from your component:

```
it('dispatches event when post is created', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'New post')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertDispatched('post-created');

});


```
Test event communication between components:

```
it('updates post count when event is dispatched', function () {

    $badge = Livewire::test('post-count-badge')

        ->assertSee('0');

 

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'New post')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertDispatched('post-created');

 

    $badge->dispatch('post-created')

        ->assertSee('1');

});


```
Assert events were dispatched with specific parameters:

```
it('dispatches notification when deleting post', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.show')

        ->call('delete', postId: 3)

        ->assertDispatched('notify', message: 'Post deleted');

});


```
For complex assertions, use a closure:

```
it('dispatches event with correct data', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.show')

        ->call('delete', postId: 3)

        ->assertDispatched('notify', function ($event, $params) {

            return ($params['message'] ?? '') === 'Post deleted';

        });

});


```


### [#](#testing-js-evaluation "Permalink")Testing JS evaluation

Assert that a component evaluated JavaScript via `$this->js()`:

```
it('shows an alert after saving', function () {

    Livewire::test('post.create')

        ->set('title', 'New post')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertJs("alert('Post saved!')");

});


```
You can also assert that no JS was evaluated:

```
->assertNoJs();


```


## [#](#using-phpunit "Permalink")Using PHPUnit

While Pest is recommended, you can absolutely use PHPUnit to test Livewire components. All the same testing utilities work with PHPUnit's syntax.

Here's a PHPUnit example for comparison:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Livewire;

use App\Models\Post;

use Tests\TestCase;

 

class CreatePostTest extends TestCase

{

    public function test_can_create_post()

    {

        $this->assertEquals(0, Post::count());

 

        Livewire::test('post.create')

            ->set('title', 'My new post')

            ->set('content', 'Post content')

            ->call('save');

 

        $this->assertEquals(1, Post::count());

    }

 

    public function test_title_is_required()

    {

        Livewire::test('post.create')

            ->set('title', '')

            ->call('save')

            ->assertHasErrors('title');

    }

}


```
All features documented on this page work identically with PHPUnit—just use PHPUnit's assertion syntax instead of Pest's.

# 0013_Alpine

# Alpine

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

[AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) is a lightweight JavaScript library that makes it easy to add client-side interactivity to your web pages. It was originally built to complement tools like Livewire where a more JavaScript-centric utility is helpful for sprinkling interactivity around your app.

Livewire ships with Alpine out of the box so there is no need to install it into your project separately.

The best place to learn about using AlpineJS is [the Alpine documentation](https://alpinejs.dev).

## [#](#a-basic-alpine-component "Permalink")A Basic Alpine component

To lay a foundation for the rest of this documentation, here is one of the most simple and informative examples of an Alpine component. A small "counter" that shows a number on the page and allows the user to increment that number by clicking a button:

```
<!-- Declare a JavaScript object of data... -->

<div x-data="{ count: 0 }">

    <!-- Render the current "count" value inside an element... -->

    <h2 x-text="count"></h2>

 

    <!-- Increment the "count" value by "1" when a click event is dispatched... -->

    <button x-on:click="count++">+</button>

</div>


```
The Alpine component above can be used inside any Livewire component in your application without a hitch. Livewire takes care of maintaining Alpine's state across Livewire component updates. In essence, you should feel free to use Alpine components inside Livewire as if you were using Alpine in any other non-Livewire context.

## [#](#using-alpine-inside-livewire "Permalink")Using Alpine inside Livewire

Let's explore a more real-life example of using an Alpine component inside a Livewire component.

Below is a simple Livewire component showing the details of a post model from the database. By default, only the title of the post is shown:

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

 

    <div x-data="{ expanded: false }">

        <button type="button" x-on:click="expanded = ! expanded">

            <span x-show="! expanded">Show post content...</span>

            <span x-show="expanded">Hide post content...</span>

        </button>

 

        <div x-show="expanded">

            {{ $post->content }}

        </div>

    </div>

</div>


```
By using Alpine, we can hide the content of the post until the user presses the "Show post content..." button. At that point, Alpine's `expanded` property will be set to `true` and the content will be shown on the page because `x-show="expanded"` is used to give Alpine control over the visibility of the post's content.

This is an example of where Alpine shines: adding interactivity into your application without triggering Livewire server-roundtrips.

## [#](#controlling-livewire-from-alpine-using-wire "Permalink")Controlling Livewire from Alpine using `$wire`

One of the most powerful features available to you as a Livewire developer is `$wire`. The `$wire` object is a magic object available to all your Alpine components that are used inside of Livewire.

You can think of `$wire` as a gateway from JavaScript into PHP. It allows you to access and modify Livewire component properties, call Livewire component methods, and do much more; all from inside AlpineJS.

### [#](#accessing-livewire-properties "Permalink")Accessing Livewire properties

Here is an example of a simple "character count" utility in a form for creating a post. This will instantly show a user how many characters are contained inside their post's content as they type:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <input wire:model="content" type="text">

 

    <small>

        Character count: <span x-text="$wire.content.length"></span>

    </small>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
As you can see `x-text` in the above example is being used to allow Alpine to control the text content of the `<span>` element. `x-text` accepts any JavaScript expression inside of it and automatically reacts when any dependencies are updated. Because we are using `$wire.content` to access the value of `$content`, Alpine will automatically update the text content every time `$wire.content` is updated from Livewire; in this case by `wire:model="content"`.

### [#](#mutating-livewire-properties "Permalink")Mutating Livewire properties

Here is an example of using `$wire` inside Alpine to clear the "title" field of a form for creating a post.

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input wire:model="title" type="text">

 

    <button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.title = ''">Clear</button>

 

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
As a user is filling out the above Livewire form, they can press "Clear" and the title field will be cleared without sending a network request from Livewire. The interaction will be "instant".

Here's a brief explanation of what's going on to make that happen:

- `x-on:click` tells Alpine to listen for a click on the button element
- When clicked, Alpine runs the provided JS expression: `$wire.title = ''`
- Because `$wire` is a magic object representing the Livewire component, all properties from your component can be accessed or mutated straight from JavaScript
- `$wire.title = ''` sets the value of `$title` in your Livewire component to an empty string
- Any Livewire utilities like `wire:model` will instantly react to this change, all without sending a server-roundtrip
- On the next Livewire network request, the `$title` property will be updated to an empty string on the backend


### [#](#calling-livewire-methods "Permalink")Calling Livewire methods

Alpine can also easily call any Livewire methods/actions by simply calling them directly on `$wire`.

Here is an example of using Alpine to listen for a "blur" event on an input and triggering a form save. The "blur" event is dispatched by the browser when a user presses "tab" to remove focus from the current element and focus on the next one on the page:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input wire:model="title" type="text" x-on:blur="$wire.save()">

 

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
Typically, you would just use `wire:model.live.blur="title"` in this situation, however, it's helpful for demonstration purposes how you can achieve this using Alpine.

#### [#](#passing-parameters "Permalink")Passing parameters

You can also pass parameters to Livewire methods by simply passing them to the `$wire` method call.

Consider a component with a `deletePost()` method like so:

```
public function deletePost($postId)

{

    $post = Post::find($postId);

 

    // Authorize user can delete...

    auth()->user()->can('update', $post);

 

    $post->delete();

}


```
Now, you can pass a `$postId` parameter to the `deletePost()` method from Alpine like so:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.deletePost(1)">


```
In general, something like a `$postId` would be generated in Blade. Here's an example of using Blade to determine which `$postId` Alpine passes into `deletePost()`:

```
@foreach ($posts as $post)

    <button type="button" wire:key="{{ $post->id }}" x-on:click="$wire.deletePost({{ $post->id }})">

        Delete "{{ $post->title }}"

    </button>

@endforeach


```
If there are three posts on the page, the above Blade template will render to something like the following in the browser:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.deletePost(1)">

    Delete "The power of walking"

</button>

 

<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.deletePost(2)">

    Delete "How to record a song"

</button>

 

<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.deletePost(3)">

    Delete "Teach what you learn"

</button>


```
As you can see, we've used Blade to render different post IDs into the Alpine `x-on:click` expressions.

#### [#](#blade-parameter-gotchas "Permalink")Blade parameter "gotchas"

This is an extremely powerful technique, but can be confusing when reading your Blade templates. It can be hard to know which parts are Blade and which parts are Alpine at first glance. Therefore, it's helpful to inspect the HTML rendered on the page to make sure what you are expecting to be rendered is accurate.

Here's an example that commonly confuses people:

Let's say, instead of an ID, your Post model uses UUIDs for indexes (IDs are integers, and UUIDs are long strings of characters).

If we render the following just like we did with an ID there will be an issue:

```
<!-- Warning: this is an example of problematic code... -->

<button

    type="button"

    x-on:click="$wire.deletePost({{ $post->uuid }})"

>


```
The above Blade template will render the following in your HTML:

```
<!-- Warning: this is an example of problematic code... -->

<button

    type="button"

    x-on:click="$wire.deletePost(93c7b04c-c9a4-4524-aa7d-39196011b81a)"

>


```
Notice the lack of quotes around the UUID string? When Alpine goes to evaluate this expression, JavaScript will throw an error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token".

To fix this, we need to add quotations around the Blade expression like so:

```
<button

    type="button"

    x-on:click="$wire.deletePost('{{ $post->uuid }}')"

>


```
Now the above template will render properly and everything will work as expected:

```
<button

    type="button"

    x-on:click="$wire.deletePost('93c7b04c-c9a4-4524-aa7d-39196011b81a')"

>


```


### [#](#refreshing-a-component "Permalink")Refreshing a component

You can easily refresh a Livewire component (trigger network roundtrip to re-render a component's Blade view) using `$wire.$refresh()`:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$refresh()">


```


## [#](#sharing-state-using-wireentangle "Permalink")Sharing state using `$wire.entangle`

You probably don't need this

In almost all cases, you should use `$wire` to directly access Livewire properties from Alpine instead of using `$wire.entangle()`. Entangling creates duplicate state that can cause predictability and performance issues. This API is maintained for backwards compatibility but is discouraged for new code.

**Do not use the `@entangle` Blade directive** - it has been deprecated and causes issues when removing DOM elements.

For rare cases where you need bidirectional state synchronization between Alpine and Livewire, you can use `$wire.entangle()`:

```
<div x-data="{ open: $wire.entangle('showDropdown') }">

    <button x-on:click="open = true">Show More...</button>

 

    <ul x-show="open">

        <li><button wire:click="archive">Archive</button></li>

    </ul>

</div>


```
By default, changes are deferred until the next Livewire request. Use `.live` to sync immediately:

```
<div x-data="{ open: $wire.entangle('showDropdown').live }">


```


## [#](#using-the-js-directive "Permalink")Using the `@js` directive

If you need to output PHP data for use in Alpine directly, you can use the `@js` directive.

```
<div x-data="{ posts: @js($posts) }">

    ...

</div>


```


## [#](#manually-bundling-alpine-in-your-javascript-build "Permalink")Manually bundling Alpine in your JavaScript build

By default, Livewire and Alpine's JavaScript is injected onto each Livewire page automatically.

This is ideal for simpler setups, however, you may want to include your own Alpine components, stores, and plugins into your project.

To include Livewire and Alpine via your own JavaScript bundle on a page is straightforward.

First, you must include the `@livewireScriptConfig` directive in your layout file like so:

```
<html>

<head>

    <!-- ... -->

    @livewireStyles

    @vite(['resources/js/app.js'])

</head>

<body>

    {{ $slot }}

 

    @livewireScriptConfig

</body>

</html>


```
This allows Livewire to provide your bundle with certain configuration it needs for your app to run properly.

Now you can import Livewire and Alpine in your `resources/js/app.js` file like so:

```
import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';

 

// Register any Alpine directives, components, or plugins here...

 

Livewire.start()


```
Here is an example of registering a custom Alpine directive called "x-clipboard" in your application:

```
import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';

 

Alpine.directive('clipboard', (el) => {

    let text = el.textContent

 

    el.addEventListener('click', () => {

        navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)

    })

})

 

Livewire.start()


```
Now the `x-clipboard` directive will be available to all your Alpine components in your Livewire application.

# 0014_Styles

# Styles

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to include component-specific styles directly in your single-file and multi-file components. These styles are automatically scoped to your component, preventing them from leaking into other parts of your application.

This approach mirrors how `<script>` tags work in Livewire components, giving you a cohesive way to keep your component's PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS all in one place.

## [#](#scoped-styles "Permalink")Scoped styles

By default, styles defined in your component are scoped to that component only. This means your CSS selectors will only affect elements within your component, even if those same selectors exist elsewhere on the page.

### [#](#single-file-components "Permalink")Single-file components

Add a `<style>` tag at the root level of your single-file component:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 0;

 

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++;

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <h1 class="title">Count: {{ $count }}</h1>

    <button class="btn" wire:click="increment">+</button>

</div>

 

<style>

.title {

    color: blue;

    font-size: 2rem;

}

 

.btn {

    background: indigo;

    color: white;

    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;

    border-radius: 0.25rem;

}

</style>


```
The `.title` and `.btn` styles will only apply to elements within this component, not to any other elements on the page with the same classes.

### [#](#multi-file-components "Permalink")Multi-file components

For multi-file components, create a CSS file with the same name as your component:

```
resources/views/components/counter/

├── counter.php

├── counter.blade.php

└── counter.css          # Scoped styles


```
`counter.css`

```
.title {

    color: blue;

    font-size: 2rem;

}

 

.btn {

    background: indigo;

    color: white;

    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;

    border-radius: 0.25rem;

}


```


## [#](#how-scoping-works "Permalink")How scoping works

Livewire automatically wraps your styles in a selector that targets your component's root element. Behind the scenes, your CSS is transformed using CSS nesting:

```
/* What you write */

.btn { background: blue; }

 

/* What gets served */

[wire\:name="counter"] {

    .btn { background: blue; }

}


```
This uses the `wire:name` attribute that Livewire adds to every component's root element, ensuring styles only apply within that component.

### [#](#targeting-the-component-root "Permalink")Targeting the component root

You can use the `&` selector to target the component's root element itself:

```
<style>

& {

    border: 2px solid gray;

    padding: 1rem;

}

 

.title {

    margin-top: 0;

}

</style>


```
This will add a border and padding to the component's outermost element.

## [#](#global-styles "Permalink")Global styles

Sometimes you need styles that apply globally rather than being scoped to a single component. Add the `global` attribute to your style tag:

### [#](#single-file-components-1 "Permalink")Single-file components

```
<style global>

body {

    font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;

}

 

.prose {

    max-width: 65ch;

    line-height: 1.6;

}

</style>


```


### [#](#multi-file-components-1 "Permalink")Multi-file components

Create a file with `.global.css` extension:

```
resources/views/components/counter/

├── counter.php

├── counter.blade.php

├── counter.css           # Scoped styles

└── counter.global.css    # Global styles


```


## [#](#combining-scoped-and-global-styles "Permalink")Combining scoped and global styles

You can use both scoped and global styles in the same component:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    // ...

};

?>

 

<div class="counter">

    <h1 class="title">My Counter</h1>

</div>

 

<style>

.title {

    color: blue;

}

</style>

 

<style global>

.counter-page-layout {

    display: grid;

    place-items: center;

}

</style>


```


## [#](#style-deduplication "Permalink")Style deduplication

Livewire automatically deduplicates styles when multiple instances of the same component appear on a page. The styles are only loaded once, regardless of how many component instances exist.

## [#](#when-to-use-component-styles "Permalink")When to use component styles

**Use scoped styles when:**

- Styling is specific to a single component
- You want to avoid CSS class name collisions
- You're building reusable, self-contained components


**Use global styles when:**

- You need to style elements outside your component
- You're defining utility classes used across multiple components
- You're overriding third-party library styles


**Use `@assets` for external stylesheets:**

- When loading CSS from a CDN
- When including third-party library styles

```
@assets

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/library.css">

@endassets


```


## [#](#browser-support "Permalink")Browser support

Scoped styles use [CSS nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting), which is supported in all modern browsers (Chrome 120+, Firefox 117+, Safari 17.2+). For older browser support, consider using a CSS preprocessor or the `@assets` directive with pre-compiled stylesheets.

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Many modern web applications are built as "single page applications" (SPAs). In these applications, each page rendered by the application no longer requires a full browser page reload, avoiding the overhead of re-downloading JavaScript and CSS assets on every request.

The alternative to a *single page application* is a *multi-page application*. In these applications, every time a user clicks a link, an entirely new HTML page is requested and rendered in the browser.

While most PHP applications have traditionally been multi-page applications, Livewire offers a single page application experience via a simple attribute you can add to links in your application: `wire:navigate`.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Let's explore an example of using `wire:navigate`. Below is a typical Laravel routes file (`routes/web.php`) with three Livewire components defined as routes:

```
use App\Livewire\Dashboard;

use App\Livewire\ShowPosts;

use App\Livewire\ShowUsers;

 

Route::livewire('/', 'pages::dashboard');

 

Route::livewire('/posts', 'pages::show-posts');

 

Route::livewire('/users', 'pages::show-users');


```
By adding `wire:navigate` to each link in a navigation menu on each page, Livewire will prevent the standard handling of the link click and replace it with its own, faster version:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/" wire:navigate>Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" wire:navigate>Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" wire:navigate>Users</a>

</nav>


```
Below is a breakdown of what happens when a `wire:navigate` link is clicked:

- User clicks a link
- Livewire prevents the browser from visiting the new page
- Instead, Livewire requests the page in the background and shows a loading bar at the top of the page
- When the HTML for the new page has been received, Livewire replaces the current page's URL, `<title>` tag and `<body>` contents with the elements from the new page


This technique results in much faster page load times — often twice as fast — and makes the application "feel" like a JavaScript powered single page application.

## [#](#redirects "Permalink")Redirects

When one of your Livewire components redirects users to another URL within your application, you can also instruct Livewire to use its `wire:navigate` functionality to load the new page. To accomplish this, provide the `navigate` argument to the `redirect()` method:

```
return $this->redirect('/posts', navigate: true);


```
Now, instead of a full page request being used to redirect the user to the new URL, Livewire will replace the contents and URL of the current page with the new one.

## [#](#prefetching-links "Permalink")Prefetching links

By default, Livewire includes a gentle strategy to *prefetch* pages before a user clicks on a link:

- A user presses down on their mouse button
- Livewire starts requesting the page
- They lift up on the mouse button to complete the *click*
- Livewire finishes the request and navigates to the new page


Surprisingly, the time between a user pressing down and lifting up on the mouse button is often enough time to load half or even an entire page from the server.

If you want an even more aggressive approach to prefetching, you may use the `.hover` modifier on a link:

```
<a href="/posts" wire:navigate.hover>Posts</a>


```
The `.hover` modifier will instruct Livewire to prefetch the page after a user has hovered over the link for `60` milliseconds.

Prefetching on hover increases server usage

Because not all users will click a link they hover over, adding `.hover` will request pages that may not be needed, though Livewire attempts to mitigate some of this overhead by waiting `60` milliseconds before prefetching the page.

## [#](#persisting-elements-across-page-visits "Permalink")Persisting elements across page visits

Sometimes, there are parts of a user interface that you need to persist between page loads, such as audio or video players. For example, in a podcasting application, a user may want to keep listening to an episode as they browse other pages.

You can achieve this in Livewire with the `@persist` directive.

By wrapping an element with `@persist` and providing it with a name, when a new page is requested using `wire:navigate`, Livewire will look for an element on the new page that has a matching `@persist`. Instead of replacing the element like normal, Livewire will use the existing DOM element from the previous page in the new page, preserving any state within the element.

Here is an example of an `<audio>` player element being persisted across pages using `@persist`:

```
@persist('player')

    <audio src="{{ $episode->file }}" controls></audio>

@endpersist


```
If the above HTML appears on both pages — the current page, and the next one — the original element will be re-used on the new page. In the case of an audio player, the audio playback won't be interrupted when navigating from one page to another.

Please be aware that the persisted element must be placed outside your Livewire components. A common practice is to position the persisted element in your main layout, such as `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.

```
<!-- resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php -->

 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

 

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        <main>

            {{ $slot }}

        </main>

 

        @persist('player')

            <audio src="{{ $episode->file }}" controls></audio>

        @endpersist

 

        @livewireScripts

    </body>

</html>


```


### [#](#highlighting-active-links "Permalink")Highlighting active links

You might be used to highlighting the currently active page link in a navbar using server-side Blade like so:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/" class="@if (request->is('/')) font-bold text-zinc-800 @endif">Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" class="@if (request->is('/posts')) font-bold text-zinc-800 @endif">Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" class="@if (request->is('/users')) font-bold text-zinc-800 @endif">Users</a>

</nav>


```
However, this will not work inside persisted elements as they are re-used between page loads. Instead, you have two options for highlighting active links during navigation:

#### [#](#using-the-data-current-attribute "Permalink")Using the `data-current` attribute

Livewire automatically adds a `data-current` attribute to any `wire:navigate` link that matches the current page. This allows you to style active links with CSS or Tailwind without any additional directives:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/dashboard" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold data-current:text-zinc-800">Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold data-current:text-zinc-800">Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold data-current:text-zinc-800">Users</a>

</nav>


```
When the `/posts` page is visited, the "Posts" link will automatically receive the `data-current` attribute and be styled accordingly.

You can also use plain CSS to style active links:

```
[data-current] {

    font-weight: bold;

    color: #18181b;

}


```
If you would like to disable this behavior while still using `wire:navigate`, you may add the `wire:current.ignore` directive:

```
<a href="/posts" wire:navigate wire:current.ignore>Posts</a>


```


#### [#](#using-the-wirecurrent-directive "Permalink")Using the `wire:current` directive

Alternatively, you can use Livewire's `wire:current` directive to add CSS classes to the currently active link:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/dashboard" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Users</a>

</nav>


```
Now, when the `/posts` page is visited, the "Posts" link will have a stronger font treatment than the other links.

Prefer data-current for simplicity

While both approaches work well, using the `data-current` attribute is often simpler and more flexible since it doesn't require an additional directive and works seamlessly with Tailwind's data attribute variants.

Read more in the [`wire:current` documentation](/docs/4.x/wire-current).

### [#](#preserving-scroll-position "Permalink")Preserving scroll position

By default, Livewire will preserve the scroll position of a page when navigating back and forth between pages. However, sometimes you may want to preserve the scroll position of an individual element you are persisting between page loads.

To do this, you must add `wire:navigate:scroll` to the element containing a scrollbar like so:

```
@persist('sidebar')

<div class="overflow-y-scroll" wire:navigate:scroll>

    <!-- ... -->

</div>

@endpersist


```


## [#](#javascript-hooks "Permalink")JavaScript hooks

Each page navigation triggers three lifecycle hooks:

- `livewire:navigate`
- `livewire:navigating`
- `livewire:navigated`


It's important to note that these hooks events are dispatched on navigations of all types. This includes manual navigation using `Livewire.navigate()`, redirecting with navigation enabled, and back and forward button presses in the browser.

Here's an example of registering listeners for each of these events:

```
document.addEventListener('livewire:navigate', (event) => {

    // Triggers when a navigation is triggered.

 

    // Can be "cancelled" (prevent the navigate from actually being performed):

    event.preventDefault()

 

    // Contains helpful context about the navigation trigger:

    let context = event.detail

 

    // A URL object of the intended destination of the navigation...

    context.url

 

    // A boolean [true/false] indicating whether or not this navigation

    // was triggered by a back/forward (history state) navigation...

    context.history

 

    // A boolean [true/false] indicating whether or not there is

    // cached version of this page to be used instead of

    // fetching a new one via a network round-trip...

    context.cached

})

 

document.addEventListener('livewire:navigating', (e) => {

    // Triggered when new HTML is about to be swapped onto the page...

 

    // This is a good place to mutate any HTML before the page

    // is navigated away from...

 

    // You can register an onSwap callback to run code after the

    // new HTML is swapped onto the page but before scripts are loaded.

    // This is a good place to apply critical styles such as dark mode

    // to prevent flickering...

    e.detail.onSwap(() => {

        // ...

    })

})

 

document.addEventListener('livewire:navigated', () => {

    // Triggered as the final step of any page navigation...

 

    // Also triggered on page-load instead of "DOMContentLoaded"...

})


```


Event listeners will persist across pages

When you attach an event listener to the document it will not be removed when you navigate to a different page. This can lead to unexpected behaviour if you need code to run only after navigating to a specific page, or if you add the same event listener on every page. If you do not remove your event listener it may cause exceptions on other pages when it's looking for elements that do not exist, or you may end up with the event listener executing multiple times per navigation.

An easy method to remove an event listener after it runs is to pass the option `{once: true}` as a third parameter to the `addEventListener` function.

```
document.addEventListener('livewire:navigated', () => {

    // ...

}, { once: true })


```

## [#](#manually-visiting-a-new-page "Permalink")Manually visiting a new page

In addition to `wire:navigate`, you can manually call the `Livewire.navigate()` method to trigger a visit to a new page using JavaScript:

```
<script>

    // ...

 

    Livewire.navigate('/new/url')

</script>


```


## [#](#using-with-analytics-software "Permalink")Using with analytics software

When navigating pages using `wire:navigate` in your app, any `<script>` tags in the `<head>` only evaluate when the page is initially loaded.

This creates a problem for analytics software such as [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/). These tools rely on a `<script>` snippet being evaluated on every single page change, not just the first.

Tools like [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) are smart enough to handle this automatically, however, when using Fathom Analytics, you must add `data-spa="auto"` to your script tag to ensure each page visit is tracked properly:

```
<head>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <!-- Fathom Analytics -->

    @if (! config('app.debug'))

        <script src="https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js" data-site="ABCDEFG" data-spa="auto" defer></script>

    @endif

</head>


```


## [#](#script-evaluation "Permalink")Script evaluation

When navigating to a new page using `wire:navigate`, it *feels* like the browser has changed pages; however, from the browser's perspective, you are technically still on the original page.

Because of this, styles and scripts are executed normally on the first page, but on subsequent pages, you may have to tweak the way you normally write JavaScript.

Here are a few caveats and scenarios you should be aware of when using `wire:navigate`.

### [#](#dont-rely-on-domcontentloaded "Permalink")Don't rely on `DOMContentLoaded`

It's common practice to place JavaScript inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener so that the code you want to run only executes after the page has fully loaded.

When using `wire:navigate`, `DOMContentLoaded` is only fired on the first page visit, not subsequent visits.

To run code on every page visit, swap every instance of `DOMContentLoaded` with `livewire:navigated`:

```
-document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

+document.addEventListener('livewire:navigated', () => {

     // ...

 })


```
Now, any code placed inside this listener will be run on the initial page visit, and also after Livewire has finished navigating to subsequent pages.

Listening to this event is useful for things like initializing third-party libraries.

### [#](#scripts-in-head-are-loaded-once "Permalink")Scripts in `<head>` are loaded once

If two pages include the same `<script>` tag in the `<head>`, that script will only be run on the initial page visit and not on subsequent page visits.

```
<!-- Page one -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js"></script>

</head>

 

<!-- Page two -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js"></script>

</head>


```


### [#](#new-head-scripts-are-evaluated "Permalink")New `<head>` scripts are evaluated

If a subsequent page includes a new `<script>` tag in the `<head>` that was not present in the `<head>` of the initial page visit, Livewire will run the new `<script>` tag.

In the below example, *page two* includes a new JavaScript library for a third-party tool. When the user navigates to *page two*, that library will be evaluated.

```
<!-- Page one -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js"></script>

</head>

 

<!-- Page two -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js"></script>

    <script src="/third-party.js"></script>

</head>


```


Head assets are blocking

If you are navigating to a new page that contains an asset like `<script src="...">` in the head tag. That asset will be fetched and processed before the navigation is complete and the new page is swapped in. This might be surprising behavior, but it ensures any scripts that depend on those assets will have immediate access to them.

### [#](#reloading-when-assets-change "Permalink")Reloading when assets change

It's common practice to include a version hash in an application's main JavaScript file name. This ensures that after deploying a new version of your application, users will receive the fresh JavaScript asset, and not an old version served from the browser's cache.

But, now that you are using `wire:navigate` and each page visit is no longer a fresh browser page load, your users may still be receiving stale JavaScript after deployments.

To prevent this, you may add `data-navigate-track` to a `<script>` tag in `<head>`:

```
<!-- Page one -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js?id=123" data-navigate-track></script>

</head>

 

<!-- Page two -->

<head>

    <script src="/app.js?id=456" data-navigate-track></script>

</head>


```
When a user visits *page two*, Livewire will detect a fresh JavaScript asset and trigger a full browser page reload.

If you are using [Laravel's Vite plug-in](https://laravel.com/docs/vite#loading-your-scripts-and-styles) to bundle and serve your assets, Livewire adds `data-navigate-track` to the rendered HTML asset tags automatically. You can continue referencing your assets and scripts like normal:

```
<head>

    @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

</head>


```
Livewire will automatically inject `data-navigate-track` onto the rendered HTML tags.

Only query string changes are tracked

Livewire will only reload a page if a `[data-navigate-track]` element's query string (`?id="456"`) changes, not the URI itself (`/app.js`).

### [#](#scripts-in-the-body-are-re-evaluated "Permalink")Scripts in the `<body>` are re-evaluated

Because Livewire replaces the entire contents of the `<body>` on every new page, all `<script>` tags on the new page will be run:

```
<!-- Page one -->

<body>

    <script>

        console.log('Runs on page one')

    </script>

</body>

 

<!-- Page two -->

<body>

    <script>

        console.log('Runs on page two')

    </script>

</body>


```
If you have a `<script>` tag in the body that you only want to be run once, you can add the `data-navigate-once` attribute to the `<script>` tag and Livewire will only run it on the initial page visit:

```
<script data-navigate-once>

    console.log('Runs only on page one')

</script>


```


## [#](#customizing-the-progress-bar "Permalink")Customizing the progress bar

When a page takes longer than 150ms to load, Livewire will show a progress bar at the top of the page.

You can customize the color of this bar or disable it all together inside Livewire's config file (`config/livewire.php`):

```
'navigate' => [

    'show_progress_bar' => false,

    'progress_bar_color' => '#2299dd',

],


```

# 0016_Islands

# Islands

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Islands allow you to create isolated regions within a Livewire component that update independently. When an action occurs inside an island, only that island re-renders — not the entire component.

This gives you the performance benefits of breaking components into smaller pieces without the overhead of creating separate child components, managing props, or dealing with component communication.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

To create an island, wrap any portion of your Blade template with the `@island` directive:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Revenue;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function revenue()

    {

        // Expensive calculation or query...

        return Revenue::yearToDate();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @island

        <div>

            Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

            <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

        </div>

    @endisland

 

    <div>

        <!-- Other content... -->

    </div>

</div>


```
When the "Refresh" button is clicked, only the island containing the revenue calculation will re-render. The rest of the component remains untouched.

Because the expensive calculation is inside a computed property—which evaluates on-demand—it will only be called when the island re-renders, not when other parts of the page update. However, since islands load with the page by default, the `revenue` property will still be calculated during the initial page load.

## [#](#lazy-loading "Permalink")Lazy loading

Sometimes you have expensive computations or slow API calls that shouldn't block your initial page load. You can defer an island's initial render until after the page loads using the `lazy` parameter:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Revenue;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function revenue()

    {

        // Expensive calculation or query...

        return Revenue::yearToDate();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @island(lazy: true)

        <div>

            Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

            <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

        </div>

    @endisland

 

    <div>

        <!-- Other content... -->

    </div>

</div>


```
The island will display a loading state initially, then fetch and render its content in a separate request.

### [#](#lazy-vs-deferred-loading "Permalink")Lazy vs Deferred loading

By default, `lazy` uses an intersection observer to trigger the load when the island becomes visible in the viewport. If you want the island to load immediately after the page loads (regardless of visibility), use `defer` instead:

```
{{-- Loads when scrolled into view --}}

@island(lazy: true)

    <!-- ... -->

@endisland

 

{{-- Loads immediately after page load --}}

@island(defer: true)

    <!-- ... -->

@endisland


```


### [#](#custom-loading-states "Permalink")Custom loading states

You can customize what displays while a lazy island is loading using the `@placeholder` directive:

```
@island(lazy: true)

    @placeholder

        <!-- Loading indicator -->

        <div class="animate-pulse">

            <div class="h-32 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>

        </div>

    @endplaceholder

 

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

    </div>

@endisland


```


## [#](#named-islands "Permalink")Named islands

To trigger an island from elsewhere in your component, give it a name and reference it using `wire:island`:

```
<div>

    @island(name: 'revenue')

        <div>

            Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

        </div>

    @endisland

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue">

        Refresh revenue

    </button>

</div>


```
The `wire:island` directive works alongside action directives like `wire:click`, `wire:submit`, etc. to scope their updates to a specific island.

When you have multiple islands with the same name, they're linked together and will always render as a group:

```
@island(name: 'revenue')

    <div class="sidebar">

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    </div>

@endisland

 

@island(name: 'revenue')

    <div class="header">

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    </div>

@endisland

 

<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue">

    Refresh revenue

</button>


```
Both islands will update together whenever one is triggered.

## [#](#append-and-prepend-modes "Permalink")Append and prepend modes

Instead of replacing content entirely, islands can append or prepend new content. This is perfect for pagination, infinite scroll, or real-time feeds:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡activity-feed.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Activity;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $page = 1;

 

    public function loadMore()

    {

        $this->page++;

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function activities()

    {

        return Activity::latest()

            ->forPage($this->page, 10)

            ->get();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @island(name: 'feed')

        @foreach ($this->activities as $activity)

            <x-activity-item wire:key="{{ $activity->id }}" :activity="$activity" />

        @endforeach

    @endisland

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="loadMore" wire:island.append="feed">

        Load more

    </button>

</div>


```
Available modes:

- `wire:island.append` - Add to the end
- `wire:island.prepend` - Add to the beginning


## [#](#nested-islands "Permalink")Nested islands

Islands can be nested inside each other. When an outer island re-renders, inner islands are skipped by default:

```
@island(name: 'revenue')

    <div>

        Total revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

        @island(name: 'breakdown')

            <div>

                Monthly breakdown: {{ $this->monthlyBreakdown }}

 

                <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">

                    Refresh breakdown

                </button>

            </div>

        @endisland

 

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">

            Refresh revenue

        </button>

    </div>

@endisland


```
Clicking "Refresh revenue" updates only the outer island, while "Refresh breakdown" updates only the inner island.

## [#](#always-render-with-parent "Permalink")Always render with parent

By default, when a component re-renders, islands are skipped. Use the `always` parameter to force an island to update whenever the parent component updates:

```
<div>

    @island(always: true)

        <div>

            Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

            <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh revenue</button>

        </div>

    @endisland

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

</div>


```
With `always: true`, the island will re-render whenever any part of the component updates. This is useful for critical data that should always stay in sync with the component state.

This also works for nested islands — an inner island with `always: true` will update whenever its parent island updates.

## [#](#skip-initial-render "Permalink")Skip initial render

The `skip` parameter prevents an island from rendering initially, perfect for on-demand content:

```
@island(skip: true)

    @placeholder

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">

            Load revenue details

        </button>

    @endplaceholder

 

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

    </div>

@endisland


```
The placeholder content will be shown initially. When triggered, the island renders and replaces the placeholder.

## [#](#island-polling "Permalink")Island polling

You can use `wire:poll` within an island to refresh just that island on an interval:

```
@island(skip: true)

    <div wire:poll.3s>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

    </div>

@endisland


```
The polling is scoped to the island — only the island will refresh every 3 seconds, not the entire component.

## [#](#triggering-islands-from-javascript "Permalink")Triggering islands from JavaScript

The `wire:island` directive only works alongside Livewire action directives like `wire:click`. To scope an action to an island from Alpine or JavaScript, use `$wire.$island()`:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed').loadMore()">

    Load more

</button>


```
This is equivalent to `wire:click="loadMore" wire:island="feed"`, but gives you the flexibility of Alpine expressions and JavaScript logic.

Append and prepend modes are supported via an options parameter:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed', { mode: 'append' }).loadMore()">

    Load more

</button>


```
Any `$wire` method works with `$island()`, including `$refresh()`, `$set()`, and `$toggle()`:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('revenue').$refresh()">

    Refresh revenue

</button>


```


## [#](#considerations "Permalink")Considerations

While islands provide powerful isolation, keep in mind:

**Data scope**: Islands have access to the component's properties and methods, but not to template variables defined outside the island. Any `@php` variables or loop variables from the parent template won't be available inside the island:

```
@php

    $localVariable = 'This won\'t be available in the island';

@endphp

 

@island

    {{-- ❌ This will error - $localVariable is not accessible --}}

    {{ $localVariable }}

 

    {{-- ✅ Component properties work fine --}}

    {{ $this->revenue }}

@endisland


```
**Islands can't be used in loops or conditionals**: Because islands don't have access to loop variables or conditional context, they cannot be used inside `@foreach`, `@if`, or other control structures:

```
{{-- ❌ This won't work --}}

@foreach ($items as $item)

    @island

        {{ $item->name }}

    @endisland

@endforeach

 

{{-- ❌ This won't work either --}}

@if ($showRevenue)

    @island

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    @endisland

@endif

 

{{-- ✅ Instead, put the loop/conditional inside the island --}}

@island

    @if ($this->showRevenue)

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    @endif

 

    @foreach ($this->items as $item)

        {{ $item->name }}

    @endforeach

@endisland


```
**State synchronization**: Although island requests run in parallel, both islands and the root component can mutate the same component state. If multiple requests are in flight simultaneously, there can be divergent state — the last response to return will win the state battle.

**When to use islands**: Islands are most beneficial for:

- Expensive computations that shouldn't block initial page load
- Independent regions with their own interactions
- Real-time updates affecting only portions of the UI
- Performance bottlenecks in large components


Islands aren't necessary for static content, tightly coupled UI, or simple components that already render quickly.

# 0017_Lazy Loading

# Lazy Loading

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to lazy load components that would otherwise slow down the initial page load.

## [#](#lazy-vs-defer "Permalink")Lazy vs Defer

Livewire provides two ways to delay component loading:

- **Lazy loading (`lazy`)**: Components load when they become visible in the viewport (when the user scrolls to them)
- **Deferred loading (`defer`)**: Components load immediately after the initial page load is complete


Both approaches prevent slow components from blocking your initial page render, but differ in when the component actually loads.

## [#](#basic-example "Permalink")Basic example

For example, imagine you have a `revenue` component which contains a slow database query in `mount()`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
Without lazy loading, this component would delay the loading of the entire page and make your entire application feel slow.

To enable lazy loading, you can pass the `lazy` parameter into the component:

```
<livewire:revenue lazy />


```
Now, instead of loading the component right away, Livewire will skip this component, loading the page without it. Then, when the component is visible in the viewport, Livewire will make a network request to fully load this component on the page.

Lazy and deferred requests are isolated by default

Unlike other network requests in Livewire, lazy and deferred component updates are isolated from each other when sent to the server. This keeps loading fast by loading each component in parallel. [Read more about bundling components →](#bundling-multiple-lazy-components)

## [#](#rendering-placeholder-html "Permalink")Rendering placeholder HTML

By default, Livewire will insert an empty `<div></div>` for your component before it is fully loaded. As the component will initially be invisible to users, it can be jarring when the component suddenly appears on the page.

To signal to your users that the component is being loaded, you can render placeholder HTML like loading spinners and skeleton placeholders.

### [#](#using-the-placeholder-directive "Permalink")Using the @placeholder directive

For single-file and multi-file components, you can use the `@placeholder` directive directly in your view to specify placeholder content:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

@placeholder

    <div>

        <!-- Loading spinner... -->

        <svg>...</svg>

    </div>

@endplaceholder

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
The content inside `@placeholder` and `@endplaceholder` will be displayed while the component is loading, then replaced with the actual component content once loaded.

Placeholder directive for view-based components only

The `@placeholder` directive is only available for view-based components (single-file and multi-file components). For class-based components, use the `placeholder()` method instead.

The placeholder and the component must share the same element type

For instance, if your placeholder's root element type is a 'div,' your component must also use a 'div' element.

### [#](#using-the-placeholder-method "Permalink")Using the placeholder() method

For class-based components, or if you prefer programmatic control, you can define a `placeholder()` method that returns HTML:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

class Revenue extends Component

{

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

 

    public function placeholder()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            <!-- Loading spinner... -->

            <svg>...</svg>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.revenue');

    }

}


```
For more complex loaders (such as skeletons) you can return a `view` from the `placeholder()` method:

```
public function placeholder(array $params = [])

{

    return view('livewire.placeholders.skeleton', $params);

}


```
Any parameters from the component being lazy loaded will be available as an `$params` argument passed to the `placeholder()` method.

## [#](#loading-immediately-after-page-load "Permalink")Loading immediately after page load

By default, lazy-loaded components aren't fully loaded until they enter the browser's viewport, for example when a user scrolls to one.

If you'd rather load components immediately after the page is loaded, without waiting for them to enter the viewport, you can use the `defer` parameter instead:

```
<livewire:revenue defer />


```
Now this component will load as soon as the page is ready without waiting for it to be visible in the viewport.

You can also use the `#[Defer]` attribute to make a component defer-loaded by default:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

 

#[Defer]

class Revenue extends Component

{

    // ...

}


```


Legacy on-load syntax

You can also use `lazy="on-load"` which behaves the same as `defer`. The `defer` parameter is recommended for new code.

## [#](#passing-in-props "Permalink")Passing in props

In general, you can treat `lazy` components the same as normal components, since you can still pass data into them from outside.

For example, here's a scenario where you might pass a time interval into the `Revenue` component from a parent component:

```
<input type="date" wire:model="start">

<input type="date" wire:model="end">

 

<livewire:revenue lazy :$start :$end />


```
You can accept this data in `mount()` just like any other component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount($start, $end)

    {

        // Expensive database query...

        $this->amount = Transactions::between($start, $end)->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

@placeholder

    <div>

        <!-- Loading spinner... -->

        <svg>...</svg>

    </div>

@endplaceholder

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
However, unlike a normal component load, a `lazy` component has to serialize or "dehydrate" any passed-in properties and temporarily store them on the client-side until the component is fully loaded.

For example, you might want to pass in an Eloquent model to the `revenue` component like so:

```
<livewire:revenue lazy :$user />


```
In a normal component, the actual PHP in-memory `$user` model would be passed into the `mount()` method of `revenue`. However, because we won't run `mount()` until the next network request, Livewire will internally serialize `$user` to JSON and then re-query it from the database before the next request is handled.

Typically, this serialization should not cause any behavioral differences in your application.

## [#](#enforcing-lazy-or-defer-by-default "Permalink")Enforcing lazy or defer by default

If you want to enforce that all usages of a component will be lazy-loaded or deferred, you can add the `#[Lazy]` or `#[Defer]` attribute above the component class:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

 

#[Lazy]

class Revenue extends Component

{

    // ...

}


```
Or for deferred loading:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

 

#[Defer]

class Revenue extends Component

{

    // ...

}


```
You can override these defaults when rendering a component:

```
{{-- Disable lazy loading --}}

<livewire:revenue :lazy="false" />

 

{{-- Disable deferred loading --}}

<livewire:revenue :defer="false" />


```


## [#](#bundling-multiple-lazy-components "Permalink")Bundling multiple lazy components

By default, if there are multiple lazy-loaded components on the page, each component will make an independent network request in parallel. This is often desirable for performance as each component loads independently.

However, if you have many lazy components on a page, you may want to bundle them into a single network request to reduce server overhead.

### [#](#using-the-bundle-parameter "Permalink")Using the bundle parameter

You can enable bundling using the `bundle: true` parameter:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

 

#[Lazy(bundle: true)]

class Revenue extends Component

{

    // ...

}


```
Now, if there are ten `Revenue` components on the same page, when the page loads, all ten updates will be bundled and sent to the server as a single network request.

### [#](#using-the-bundle-modifier "Permalink")Using the bundle modifier

You can also enable bundling inline when rendering a component using the bundle modifier:

```
<livewire:revenue lazy.bundle />


```
This also works with deferred components:

```
<livewire:revenue defer.bundle />


```
Or using the attribute:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

 

#[Defer(bundle: true)]

class Revenue extends Component

{

    // ...

}


```


### [#](#when-to-use-bundling "Permalink")When to use bundling

**Use bundling when:**

- You have many (5+) lazy or deferred components on a single page
- The components are similar in complexity and load time
- You want to reduce server overhead and HTTP connection count


**Don't use bundling when:**

- Components have vastly different load times (slow components will block fast ones)
- You want components to appear as soon as they're individually ready
- You only have a few lazy components on the page


Legacy isolate syntax

You can also use `isolate: false` which behaves the same as `bundle: true`. The `bundle` parameter is recommended for new code as it's more explicit about the intent.

## [#](#full-page-lazy-loading "Permalink")Full-page lazy loading

You can lazy load or defer full-page Livewire components using route methods.

### [#](#lazy-loading-full-pages "Permalink")Lazy loading full pages

Use `->lazy()` to load the component when it enters the viewport:

```
Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard')->lazy();


```


### [#](#deferring-full-pages "Permalink")Deferring full pages

Use `->defer()` to load the component immediately after the page loads:

```
Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard')->defer();


```


### [#](#disabling-lazydefer-loading "Permalink")Disabling lazy/defer loading

If a component is lazy or deferred by default (via the `#[Lazy]` or `#[Defer]` attribute), you can opt-out using `enabled: false`:

```
Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard')->lazy(enabled: false);

Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard')->defer(enabled: false);


```


## [#](#default-placeholder-view "Permalink")Default placeholder view

If you want to set a default placeholder view for all your components you can do so by referencing the view in the `/config/livewire.php` config file:

```
'component_placeholder' => 'livewire.placeholder',


```
Now, when a component is lazy-loaded and no `placeholder()` is defined, Livewire will use the configured Blade view (`livewire.placeholder` in this case.)

## [#](#disabling-lazy-loading-for-tests "Permalink")Disabling lazy loading for tests

When unit testing a lazy component, or a page with nested lazy components, you may want to disable the "lazy" behavior so that you can assert the final rendered behavior. Otherwise, those components would be rendered as their placeholders during your tests.

You can easily disable lazy loading using the `Livewire::withoutLazyLoading()` testing helper like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature\Livewire;

 

use App\Livewire\Dashboard;

use Livewire\Livewire;

use Tests\TestCase;

 

class DashboardTest extends TestCase

{

    public function test_renders_successfully()

    {

        Livewire::withoutLazyLoading()

            ->test(Dashboard::class)

            ->assertSee(...);

    }

}


```
Now, when the dashboard component is rendered for this test, it will skip rendering the `placeholder()` and instead render the full component as if lazy loading wasn't applied at all.

# 0018_Loading States

# Loading States

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

When a user interacts with your Livewire components, providing visual feedback during network requests is essential for a good user experience. Livewire automatically adds a `data-loading` attribute to any element that triggers a network request, making it easy to style loading states.

Prefer data-loading over wire:loading

Livewire also provides the [`wire:loading`](/docs/4.x/wire-loading) directive for toggling elements during requests. While `wire:loading` is simpler for basic show/hide scenarios, it has more limitations (requiring `wire:target` for specificity, doesn't work well with events across components, etc.). For most use cases, you should prefer using `data-loading` selectors as demonstrated in this guide.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Livewire automatically adds a `data-loading` attribute to any element that triggers a network request. This allows you to style loading states directly with CSS or Tailwind without using `wire:loading` directives.

Here's a simple example using a button with `wire:click`:

```
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50">

    Save Changes

</button>


```
When the button is clicked and the request is in-flight, it will automatically become semi-transparent thanks to the `data-loading` attribute being present on the element.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

The `data-loading` attribute is automatically added to elements that trigger network requests, including:

- Actions: `wire:click="save"`
- Form submissions: `wire:submit="create"`
- Property updates: `wire:model.live="search"`
- Events: `wire:click="$dispatch('refresh')"`


Importantly, the attribute is added even when dispatching events that are handled by other components:

```
<button wire:click="$dispatch('refresh-stats')">

    Refresh

</button>


```
Even though the event is picked up by a different component, the button that dispatched the event will still receive the `data-loading` attribute during the network request.

## [#](#styling-with-tailwind "Permalink")Styling with Tailwind

Tailwind v4 and above provides powerful selectors for working with the `data-loading` attribute.

### [#](#basic-styling "Permalink")Basic styling

Use Tailwind's `data-loading:` variant to apply styles when an element is loading:

```
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50">

    Save

</button>


```


### [#](#showing-elements-during-loading "Permalink")Showing elements during loading

To show an element only while loading is active, use the `not-data-loading:hidden` variant:

```
<button wire:click="save">

    Save

</button>

 

<span class="not-data-loading:hidden">

    Saving...

</span>


```
This approach is preferred over `hidden data-loading:block` because it works regardless of the element's display type (flex, inline, grid, etc.).

### [#](#styling-children "Permalink")Styling children

You can style child elements when a parent has the `data-loading` attribute using the `in-data-loading:` variant:

```
<button wire:click="save">

    <span class="in-data-loading:hidden">Save</span>

    <span class="not-in-data-loading:hidden">Saving...</span>

</button>


```


The in-data-loading variant applies to all ancestors

The `in-data-loading:` variant will trigger if **any** ancestor element (no matter how far up the tree) has the `data-loading` attribute. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you have nested loading states.

### [#](#styling-parents "Permalink")Styling parents

Style parent elements when they contain a child with `data-loading` using the `has-data-loading:` variant:

```
<div class="has-data-loading:opacity-50">

    <button wire:click="save">Save</button>

</div>


```
When the button is clicked, the entire parent div will become semi-transparent.

### [#](#styling-siblings "Permalink")Styling siblings

You can style sibling elements using Tailwind's `peer` utility with the `peer-data-loading:` variant:

```
<div>

    <button wire:click="save" class="peer">

        Save

    </button>

 

    <span class="peer-data-loading:opacity-50">

        Saving...

    </span>

</div>


```


### [#](#complex-selectors "Permalink")Complex selectors

For more advanced styling needs, you can use arbitrary variants to target specific elements:

```
<!-- Style all direct children when loading -->

<div class="[&[data-loading]>*]:opacity-50" wire:click="save">

    <span>Child 1</span>

    <span>Child 2</span>

</div>

 

<!-- Style specific descendant elements -->

<button class="[&[data-loading]_.icon]:animate-spin" wire:click="save">

    <svg class="icon"><!-- spinner --></svg>

    Save

</button>


```
Learn more about Tailwind's state variants and arbitrary selectors in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).

## [#](#advantages-over-wireloading "Permalink")Advantages over wire:loading

The `data-loading` attribute approach offers several advantages over the traditional `wire:loading` directive:

1. **No targeting needed**: Unlike `wire:loading` which often requires `wire:target` to specify which action to respond to, the `data-loading` attribute is automatically scoped to the element that triggered the request.

2. **More elegant styling**: Tailwind's variant system provides a cleaner, more declarative way to style loading states directly in your markup.

3. **Works with events**: The attribute is added even when dispatching events that are handled by other components, something that was previously difficult to achieve with `wire:loading`.

4. **Better composition**: Styling with Tailwind variants composes better with other utility classes and states.

## [#](#tailwind-4-requirement "Permalink")Tailwind 4 requirement

Tailwind v4+ required for advanced variants

The `in-data-loading:`, `has-data-loading:`, `peer-data-loading:`, and `not-data-loading:` variants require Tailwind CSS v4 or above. If you're using an earlier version of Tailwind, you can still target the `data-loading` attribute using the `data-loading:` syntax or standard CSS.

## [#](#using-with-plain-css "Permalink")Using with plain CSS

If you're not using Tailwind, you can target the `data-loading` attribute with standard CSS:

```
[data-loading] {

    opacity: 0.5;

}

 

button[data-loading] {

    background-color: #ccc;

}


```
You can also use CSS to style child elements:

```
[data-loading] .loading-text {

    display: inline;

}

 

[data-loading] .default-text {

    display: none;

}


```

# 0019_Validation

# Validation

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire aims to make validating a user's input and giving them feedback as pleasant as possible. By building on top of Laravel's validation features, Livewire leverages your existing knowledge while also providing you with robust, additional features like real-time validation.

Here's an example `CreatePost` component that demonstrates the most basic validation workflow in Livewire:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $validated = $this->validate([

            'title' => 'required|min:3',

            'content' => 'required|min:3',

        ]);

 

        Post::create($validated);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.create-post');

    }

}


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    <div>@error('title') {{ $message }} @enderror</div>

 

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

    <div>@error('content') {{ $message }} @enderror</div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
As you can see, Livewire provides a `validate()` method that you can call to validate your component's properties. It returns the validated set of data that you can then safely insert into the database.

On the frontend, you can use Laravel's existing Blade directives to show validation messages to your users.

For more information, see [Laravel's documentation on rendering validation errors in Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#validation-errors).

## [#](#validate-attributes "Permalink")Validate attributes

If you prefer to co-locate your component's validation rules with the properties directly, you can use Livewire's `#[Validate]` attribute.

By associating validation rules with properties using `#[Validate]`, Livewire will automatically run the properties validation rules before each update. However, you should still run `$this->validate()` before persisting data to a database so that properties that haven't been updated are also validated.

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


Validate attributes don't support Rule objects

PHP Attributes are restricted to certain syntaxes like plain strings and arrays. If you find yourself wanting to use run-time syntaxes like Laravel's Rule objects (`Rule::exists(...)`) you should instead [define a `rules()` method](#defining-a-rules-method) in your component.

Learn more in the documentation on [using Laravel Rule objects with Livewire](#using-laravel-rule-objects).

If you prefer more control over when the properties are validated, you can pass a `onUpdate: false` parameter to the `#[Validate]` attribute. This will disable any automatic validation and instead assume you want to manually validate the properties using the `$this->validate()` method:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    #[Validate('required|min:3', onUpdate: false)]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3', onUpdate: false)]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $validated = $this->validate();

 

        Post::create($validated);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


### [#](#custom-attribute-name "Permalink")Custom attribute name

If you wish to customize the attribute name injected into the validation message, you may do so using the `as: ` parameter:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate('required', as: 'date of birth')]

public $dob;


```
When validation fails in the above snippet, Laravel will use "date of birth" instead of "dob" as the name of the field in the validation message. The generated message will be "The date of birth field is required" instead of "The dob field is required".

### [#](#custom-validation-message "Permalink")Custom validation message

To bypass Laravel's validation message and replace it with your own, you can use the `message: ` parameter in the `#[Validate]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate('required', message: 'Please provide a post title')]

public $title;


```
Now, when the validation fails for this property, the message will be "Please provide a post title" instead of "The title field is required".

If you wish to add different messages for different rules, you can simply provide multiple `#[Validate]` attributes:

```
#[Validate('required', message: 'Please provide a post title')]

#[Validate('min:3', message: 'This title is too short')]

public $title;


```


### [#](#opting-out-of-localization "Permalink")Opting out of localization

By default, Livewire rule messages and attributes are localized using Laravel's translate helper: `trans()`.

You can opt-out of localization by passing the `translate: false` parameter to the `#[Validate]` attribute:

```
#[Validate('required', message: 'Please provide a post title', translate: false)]

public $title;


```


### [#](#custom-key "Permalink")Custom key

When applying validation rules directly to a property using the `#[Validate]` attribute, Livewire assumes the validation key should be the name of the property itself. However, there are times when you may want to customize the validation key.

For example, you might want to provide separate validation rules for an array property and its children. In this case, instead of passing a validation rule as the first argument to the `#[Validate]` attribute, you can pass an array of key-value pairs instead:

```
#[Validate([

    'todos' => 'required',

    'todos.*' => [

        'required',

        'min:3',

        new Uppercase,

    ],

])]

public $todos = [];


```
Now, when a user updates `$todos`, or the `validate()` method is called, both of these validation rules will be applied.

## [#](#form-objects "Permalink")Form objects

As more properties and validation rules are added to a Livewire component, it can begin to feel too crowded. To alleviate this pain and also provide a helpful abstraction for code reuse, you can use Livewire's *Form Objects* to store your properties and validation rules.

Below is the same `CreatePost` example, but now the properties and rules have been extracted to a dedicated form object named `PostForm`:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire\Forms;

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class PostForm extends Form

{

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $content = '';

}


```
The `PostForm` above can now be defined as a property on the `CreatePost` component:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use App\Livewire\Forms\PostForm;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public PostForm $form;

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create(

            $this->form->all()

        );

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```
As you can see, instead of listing out each property individually, we can retrieve all the property values using the `->all()` method on the form object.

Also, when referencing the property names in the template, you must prepend `form.` to each instance:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="form.title">

    <div>@error('form.title') {{ $message }} @enderror</div>

 

    <textarea wire:model="form.content"></textarea>

    <div>@error('form.content') {{ $message }} @enderror</div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
When using form objects, `#[Validate]` attribute validation will be run every time a property is updated. However, if you disable this behavior by specifying `onUpdate: false` on the attribute, you can manually run a form object's validation using `$this->form->validate()`:

```
public function save()

{

    Post::create(

        $this->form->validate()

    );

 

    return redirect()->to('/posts');

}


```
Form objects are a useful abstraction for most larger datasets and a variety of additional features that make them even more powerful. For more information, check out the comprehensive [form object documentation](/docs/4.x/forms#extracting-a-form-object).

## [#](#real-time-validation "Permalink")Real-time validation

Real-time validation is the term used for when you validate a user's input as they fill out a form rather than waiting for the form submission.

By using `#[Validate]` attributes directly on Livewire properties, any time a network request is sent to update a property's value on the server, the provided validation rules will be applied.

This means to provide a real-time validation experience for your users on a specific input, no extra backend work is required. The only thing that is required is using `wire:model.live` or `wire:model.live.blur` to instruct Livewire to trigger network requests as the fields are filled out.

In the below example, `wire:model.live.blur` has been added to the text input. Now, when a user types in the field and then tabs or clicks away from the field, a network request will be triggered with the updated value and the validation rules will run:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title">

 

    <!-- -->

</form>


```
If you are using a `rules()` method to declare your validation rules for a property instead of the `#[Validate]` attribute, you can still include a #[Validate] attribute with no parameters to retain the real-time validating behavior:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    #[Validate]

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    protected function rules()

    {

        return [

            'title' => 'required|min:5',

            'content' => 'required|min:5',

        ];

    }

 

    public function save()

    {

        $validated = $this->validate();

 

        Post::create($validated);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }


```
Now, in the above example, even though `#[Validate]` is empty, it will tell Livewire to run the fields validation provided by `rules()` everytime the property is updated.

## [#](#customizing-error-messages "Permalink")Customizing error messages

Out-of-the-box, Laravel provides sensible validation messages like "The title field is required." if the `$title` property has the `required` rule attached to it.

However, you may need to customize the language of these error messages to better suite your application and its users.

### [#](#custom-attribute-names "Permalink")Custom attribute names

Sometimes the property you are validating has a name that isn't suited for displaying to users. For example, if you have a database field in your app named `dob` that stands for "Date of birth", you would want to show your users "The date of birth field is required" instead of "The dob field is required".

Livewire allows you to specify an alternative name for a property using the `as: ` parameter:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate('required', as: 'date of birth')]

public $dob = '';


```
Now, if the `required` validation rule fails, the error message will state "The date of birth field is required." instead of "The dob field is required.".

### [#](#custom-messages "Permalink")Custom messages

If customizing the property name isn't enough, you can customize the entire validation message using the `message: ` parameter:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate('required', message: 'Please fill out your date of birth.')]

public $dob = '';


```
If you have multiple rules to customize the message for, it is recommended that you use entirely separate `#[Validate]` attributes for each, like so:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate('required', message: 'Please enter a title.')]

#[Validate('min:5', message: 'Your title is too short.')]

public $title = '';


```
If you want to use the `#[Validate]` attribute's array syntax instead, you can specify custom attributes and messages like so:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

#[Validate([

    'titles' => 'required',

    'titles.*' => 'required|min:5',

], message: [

    'required' => 'The :attribute is missing.',

    'titles.required' => 'The :attribute are missing.',

    'min' => 'The :attribute is too short.',

], attribute: [

    'titles.*' => 'title',

])]

public $titles = [];


```


## [#](#defining-a-rules-method "Permalink")Defining a `rules()` method

As an alternative to Livewire's `#[Validate]` attributes, you can define a method in your component called `rules()` and return a list of fields and corresponding validation rules. This can be helpful if you are trying to use run-time syntaxes that aren't supported in PHP Attributes, for example, Laravel rule objects like `Rule::password()`.

These rules will then be applied when you run `$this->validate()` inside the component. You also can define the `messages()` and `validationAttributes()` functions.

Here's an example:

```
use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

use Illuminate\Validation\Rule;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    protected function rules()

    {

        return [

            'title' => Rule::exists('posts', 'title'),

            'content' => 'required|min:3',

        ];

    }

 

    protected function messages()

    {

        return [

            'content.required' => 'The :attribute are missing.',

            'content.min' => 'The :attribute is too short.',

        ];

    }

 

    protected function validationAttributes()

    {

        return [

            'content' => 'description',

        ];

    }

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


The`rules()` method doesn't validate on data updates

When defining rules via the `rules()` method, Livewire will ONLY use these validation rules to validate properties when you run `$this->validate()`. This is different than standard `#[Validate]` attributes which are applied every time a field is updated via something like `wire:model`. To apply these validation rules to a property every time it's updated, you can still use `#[Validate]` with no extra parameters.

Don't conflict with Livewire's mechanisms

While using Livewire's validation utilities, your component should **not** have properties or methods named `rules`, `messages`, `validationAttributes` or `validationCustomValues`, unless you're customizing the validation process. Otherwise, those will conflict with Livewire's mechanisms.

## [#](#using-laravel-rule-objects "Permalink")Using Laravel Rule objects

Laravel `Rule` objects are an extremely powerful way to add advanced validation behavior to your forms.

Here is an example of using Rule objects in conjunction with Livewire's `rules()` method to achieve more sophisticated validation:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Illuminate\Validation\Rule;

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Form;

 

class UpdatePost extends Form

{

    public ?Post $post;

 

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    protected function rules()

    {

        return [

            'title' => [

                'required',

                Rule::unique('posts')->ignore($this->post),

            ],

            'content' => 'required|min:5',

        ];

    }

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->title = $this->post->title;

        $this->content = $this->post->content;

    }

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        $this->post->update($this->all());

 

        $this->reset();

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


## [#](#manually-controlling-validation-errors "Permalink")Manually controlling validation errors

Livewire's validation utilities should handle the most common validation scenarios; however, there are times when you may want full control over the validation messages in your component.

Below are all the available methods for manipulating the validation errors in your Livewire component:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$this->addError([key], [message])` | Manually add a validation message to the error bag |
| `$this->resetValidation([?key])` | Reset the validation errors for the provided key, or reset all errors if no key is supplied |
| `$this->getErrorBag()` | Retrieve the underlying Laravel error bag used in the Livewire component |


Using`$this->addError()` with Form Objects

When manually adding errors using `$this->addError` inside of a form object the key will automatically be prefixed with the name of the property the form is assigned to in the parent component. For example, if in your Component you assign the form to a property called `$data`, key will become `data.key`.

## [#](#accessing-the-validator-instance "Permalink")Accessing the validator instance

Sometimes you may want to access the Validator instance that Livewire uses internally in the `validate()` method. This is possible using the `withValidator` method. The closure you provide receives the fully constructed validator as an argument, allowing you to call any of its methods before the validation rules are actually evaluated.

Below is an example of intercepting Livewire's internal validator to manually check a condition and add an additional validation message:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function boot()

    {

        $this->withValidator(function ($validator) {

            $validator->after(function ($validator) {

                if (str($this->title)->startsWith('"')) {

                    $validator->errors()->add('title', 'Titles cannot start with quotations');

                }

            });

        });

    }

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create($this->all());

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


## [#](#using-custom-validators "Permalink")Using custom validators

If you wish to use your own validation system in Livewire, that isn't a problem. Livewire will catch any `ValidationException` exceptions thrown inside of components and provide the errors to the view just as if you were using Livewire's own `validate()` method.

Below is an example of the `CreatePost` component, but instead of using Livewire's validation features, a completely custom validator is being created and applied to the component properties:

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $validated = Validator::make(

            // Data to validate...

            ['title' => $this->title, 'content' => $this->content],

 

            // Validation rules to apply...

            ['title' => 'required|min:3', 'content' => 'required|min:3'],

 

            // Custom validation messages...

            ['required' => 'The :attribute field is required'],

         )->validate();

 

        Post::create($validated);

 

        return redirect()->to('/posts');

    }

 

    // ...

}


```


## [#](#testing-validation "Permalink")Testing validation

Livewire provides useful testing utilities for validation scenarios, such as the `assertHasErrors()` method.

Below is a basic test case that ensures validation errors are thrown if no input is set for the `title` property:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature\Livewire;

 

use App\Livewire\CreatePost;

use Livewire\Livewire;

use Tests\TestCase;

 

class CreatePostTest extends TestCase

{

    public function test_cant_create_post_without_title()

    {

        Livewire::test(CreatePost::class)

            ->set('content', 'Sample content...')

            ->call('save')

            ->assertHasErrors('title');

    }

}


```
In addition to testing the presence of errors, `assertHasErrors` allows you to also narrow down the assertion to specific rules by passing the rules to assert against as the second argument to the method:

```
public function test_cant_create_post_with_title_shorter_than_3_characters()

{

    Livewire::test(CreatePost::class)

        ->set('title', 'Sa')

        ->set('content', 'Sample content...')

        ->call('save')

        ->assertHasErrors(['title' => ['min:3']]);

}


```
You can also assert the presence of validation errors for multiple properties at the same time:

```
public function test_cant_create_post_without_title_and_content()

{

    Livewire::test(CreatePost::class)

        ->call('save')

        ->assertHasErrors(['title', 'content']);

}


```
For more information on other testing utilities provided by Livewire, check out the [testing documentation](/docs/4.x/testing).

## [#](#accessing-errors-in-javascript "Permalink")Accessing errors in JavaScript

Livewire provides a `$errors` magic property for client-side access to validation errors:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="email" wire:model="email">

 

    <div wire:show="$errors.has('email')">

        <span wire:text="$errors.first('email')"></span>

    </div>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```


### [#](#available-methods "Permalink")Available methods

- `$errors.has('field')` - Check if a field has errors
- `$errors.first('field')` - Get the first error message for a field
- `$errors.get('field')` - Get all error messages for a field
- `$errors.all()` - Get all errors for all fields
- `$errors.clear()` - Clear all errors
- `$errors.clear('field')` - Clear errors for a specific field


When using Alpine.js, access `$errors` through `$wire.$errors`.

## [#](#deprecated-rule-attribute "Permalink")Deprecated `[#Rule]` attribute

When Livewire v3 first launched, it used the term "Rule" instead of "Validate" for it's validation attributes (`#[Rule]`).

Because of naming conflicts with Laravel rule objects, this has since been changed to `#[Validate]`. Both are supported in Livewire v3, however it is recommended that you change all occurrences of `#[Rule]` with `#[Validate]` to stay current.

# 0020_File Uploads

# File Uploads

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire offers powerful support for uploading files within your components.

First, add the `WithFileUploads` trait to your component. Once this trait has been added to your component, you can use `wire:model` on file inputs as if they were any other input type and Livewire will take care of the rest.

Here's an example of a simple component that handles uploading a photo:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡upload-photo.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\WithFileUploads;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithFileUploads;

 

    #[Validate('image|max:1024')] // 1MB Max

    public $photo;

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->photo->store(path: 'photos');

    }

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

    @error('photo') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <button type="submit">Save photo</button>

</form>


```


The "upload" method is reserved

Notice the above example uses a "save" method instead of an "upload" method. This is a common "gotcha". The term "upload" is reserved by Livewire. You cannot use it as a method or property name in your component.

From the developer's perspective, handling file inputs is no different than handling any other input type: Add `wire:model` to the `<input>` tag and everything else is taken care of for you.

However, more is happening under the hood to make file uploads work in Livewire. Here's a glimpse at what goes on when a user selects a file to upload:

1. When a new file is selected, Livewire's JavaScript makes an initial request to the component on the server to get a temporary "signed" upload URL.
2. Once the URL is received, JavaScript does the actual "upload" to the signed URL, storing the upload in a temporary directory designated by Livewire and returning the new temporary file's unique hash ID.
3. Once the file is uploaded and the unique hash ID is generated, Livewire's JavaScript makes a final request to the component on the server, telling it to "set" the desired public property to the new temporary file.
4. Now, the public property (in this case, `$photo`) is set to the temporary file upload and is ready to be stored or validated at any point.


## [#](#storing-uploaded-files "Permalink")Storing uploaded files

The previous example demonstrates the most basic storage scenario: moving the temporarily uploaded file to the "photos" directory on the application's default filesystem disk.

However, you may want to customize the file name of the stored file or even specify a specific storage "disk" to keep the file on (such as S3).

Original file names

You can access the original file name of a temporary upload, by calling its `->getClientOriginalName()` method.

Livewire honors the same APIs Laravel uses for storing uploaded files, so feel free to consult [Laravel's file upload documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem#file-uploads). However, below are a few common storage scenarios and examples:

```
public function save()

{

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory of the default filesystem disk

    $this->photo->store(path: 'photos');

 

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory in a configured "s3" disk

    $this->photo->store(path: 'photos', options: 's3');

 

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory with the filename "avatar.png"

    $this->photo->storeAs(path: 'photos', name: 'avatar');

 

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory in a configured "s3" disk with the filename "avatar.png"

    $this->photo->storeAs(path: 'photos', name: 'avatar', options: 's3');

 

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory, with "public" visibility in a configured "s3" disk

    $this->photo->storePublicly(path: 'photos', options: 's3');

 

    // Store the file in the "photos" directory, with the name "avatar.png", with "public" visibility in a configured "s3" disk

    $this->photo->storePubliclyAs(path: 'photos', name: 'avatar', options: 's3');

}


```


## [#](#handling-multiple-files "Permalink")Handling multiple files

Livewire automatically handles multiple file uploads by detecting the `multiple` attribute on the `<input>` tag.

For example, below is a component with an array property named `$photos`. By adding `multiple` to the form's file input, Livewire will automatically append new files to this array:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡upload-photos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\WithFileUploads;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithFileUploads;

 

    #[Validate(['photos.*' => 'image|max:1024'])]

    public $photos = [];

 

    public function save()

    {

        foreach ($this->photos as $photo) {

            $photo->store(path: 'photos');

        }

    }

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="file" wire:model="photos" multiple>

 

    @error('photos.*') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <button type="submit">Save photo</button>

</form>


```


## [#](#file-validation "Permalink")File validation

Like we've discussed, validating file uploads with Livewire is the same as handling file uploads from a standard Laravel controller.

Ensure S3 is properly configured

Many of the validation rules relating to files require access to the file. When [uploading directly to S3](#uploading-directly-to-amazon-s3), these validation rules will fail if the S3 file object is not publicly accessible.

For more information on file validation, consult [Laravel's file validation documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).

## [#](#temporary-preview-urls "Permalink")Temporary preview URLs

After a user chooses a file, you should typically show them a preview of that file before they submit the form and store the file.

Livewire makes this trivial by using the `->temporaryUrl()` method on uploaded files.

Temporary URLs are restricted to images

For security reasons, temporary preview URLs are only supported on files with image MIME types.

Let's explore an example of a file upload with an image preview:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡upload-photo.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\WithFileUploads;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithFileUploads;

 

    #[Validate('image|max:1024')]

    public $photo;

 

    // ...

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    @if ($photo)

        <img src="{{ $photo->temporaryUrl() }}">

    @endif

 

    <input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

    @error('photo') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <button type="submit">Save photo</button>

</form>


```
As previously discussed, Livewire stores temporary files in a non-public directory; therefore, typically there's no simple way to expose a temporary, public URL to your users for image previewing.

However, Livewire solves this issue by providing a temporary, signed URL that pretends to be the uploaded image so your page can show an image preview to your users.

This URL is protected against showing files in directories above the temporary directory. And, because it's signed, users can't abuse this URL to preview other files on your system.

S3 temporary signed URLs

If you've configured Livewire to use S3 for temporary file storage, calling `->temporaryUrl()` will generate a temporary, signed URL to S3 directly so that image previews aren't loaded from your Laravel application server.

## [#](#testing-file-uploads "Permalink")Testing file uploads

You can use Laravel's existing file upload testing helpers to test file uploads.

Below is a complete example of testing the `UploadPhoto` component with Livewire:

```
<?php

 

namespace Tests\Feature\Livewire;

 

use Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

use App\Livewire\UploadPhoto;

use Livewire\Livewire;

use Tests\TestCase;

 

class UploadPhotoTest extends TestCase

{

    public function test_can_upload_photo()

    {

        Storage::fake('avatars');

 

        $file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('avatar.png');

 

        Livewire::test(UploadPhoto::class)

            ->set('photo', $file)

            ->call('upload', 'uploaded-avatar.png');

 

        Storage::disk('avatars')->assertExists('uploaded-avatar.png');

    }

}


```
Below is an example of the `upload-photo` component required to make the previous test pass:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡upload-photo.blade.php

 

use Livewire\WithFileUploads;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithFileUploads;

 

    public $photo;

 

    public function upload($name)

    {

        $this->photo->storeAs('/', $name, disk: 'avatars');

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
For more information on testing file uploads, please consult [Laravel's file upload testing documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/http-tests#testing-file-uploads).

## [#](#uploading-directly-to-amazon-s3 "Permalink")Uploading directly to Amazon S3

As previously discussed, Livewire stores all file uploads in a temporary directory until the developer permanently stores the file.

By default, Livewire uses the default filesystem disk configuration (usually `local`) and stores the files within a `livewire-tmp/` directory.

Consequently, file uploads are always utilizing your application server, even if you choose to store the uploaded files in an S3 bucket later.

If you wish to bypass your application server and instead store Livewire's temporary uploads in an S3 bucket, set the `LIVEWIRE_TEMPORARY_FILE_UPLOAD_DISK` environment variable in your `.env` file to `s3` (or another custom disk that uses the `s3` driver):

```
LIVEWIRE_TEMPORARY_FILE_UPLOAD_DISK=s3


```
Now, when a user uploads a file, the file will never actually be stored on your server. Instead, it will be uploaded directly to your S3 bucket within the `livewire-tmp/` sub-directory.

Alternatively, you can publish Livewire's configuration file with `php artisan livewire:config` for full control over the `temporary_file_upload` config.

### [#](#configuring-automatic-file-cleanup "Permalink")Configuring automatic file cleanup

Livewire's temporary upload directory will fill up with files quickly; therefore, it's essential to configure S3 to clean up files older than 24 hours.

To configure this behavior, run the following Artisan command from the environment that is utilizing an S3 bucket for file uploads:

```
php artisan livewire:configure-s3-upload-cleanup


```
Now, any temporary files older than 24 hours will be cleaned up by S3 automatically.

If you are not using S3 for file storage, Livewire will handle file cleanup automatically and there is no need to run the command above.

## [#](#loading-indicators "Permalink")Loading indicators

Although `wire:model` for file uploads works differently than other `wire:model` input types under the hood, the interface for showing loading indicators remains the same.

You can display a loading indicator scoped to the file upload using `wire:loading`:

```
<input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

<div wire:loading wire:target="photo">Uploading...</div>


```
Or more simply using Livewire's automatic `data-loading` attribute:

```
<div>

    <input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

    <div class="not-data-loading:hidden">Uploading...</div>

</div>


```
Now, while the file is uploading, the "Uploading..." message will be shown and then hidden when the upload is finished.

[Learn more about loading states →](/docs/4.x/loading-states)

## [#](#progress-indicators "Permalink")Progress indicators

Every Livewire file upload operation dispatches JavaScript events on the corresponding `<input>` element, allowing custom JavaScript to intercept the events:

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `livewire-upload-start` | Dispatched when the upload starts |
| `livewire-upload-finish` | Dispatched if the upload is successfully finished |
| `livewire-upload-cancel` | Dispatched if the upload was cancelled prematurely |
| `livewire-upload-error` | Dispatched if the upload fails |
| `livewire-upload-progress` | An event containing the upload progress percentage as the upload progresses |


Below is an example of wrapping a Livewire file upload in an Alpine component to display an upload progress bar:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <div

        x-data="{ uploading: false, progress: 0 }"

        x-on:livewire-upload-start="uploading = true"

        x-on:livewire-upload-finish="uploading = false"

        x-on:livewire-upload-cancel="uploading = false"

        x-on:livewire-upload-error="uploading = false"

        x-on:livewire-upload-progress="progress = $event.detail.progress"

    >

        <!-- File Input -->

        <input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

        <!-- Progress Bar -->

        <div x-show="uploading">

            <progress max="100" x-bind:value="progress"></progress>

        </div>

    </div>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```


## [#](#cancelling-an-upload "Permalink")Cancelling an upload

If an upload is taking a long time, a user may want to cancel it. You can provide this functionality with Livewire's `$cancelUpload()` function in JavaScript.

Here's an example of creating a "Cancel Upload" button in a Livewire component using `wire:click` to handle the click event:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- File Input -->

    <input type="file" wire:model="photo">

 

    <!-- Cancel upload button -->

    <button type="button" wire:click="$cancelUpload('photo')">Cancel Upload</button>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```
When "Cancel upload" is pressed, the file upload will request will be aborted and the file input will be cleared. The user can now attempt another upload with a different file.

Alternatively, you can call `cancelUpload(...)` from Alpine like so:

```
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.cancelUpload('photo')">Cancel Upload</button>


```


## [#](#javascript-upload-api "Permalink")JavaScript upload API

Integrating with third-party file-uploading libraries often requires more control than a simple `<input type="file" wire:model="...">` element.

For these scenarios, Livewire exposes dedicated JavaScript functions.

These functions exist on a JavaScript component object, which can be accessed using Livewire's convenient `$wire` object from within your Livewire component's template:

```
<script>

    let file = $wire.el.querySelector('input[type="file"]').files[0]

 

    // Upload a file...

    $wire.upload('photo', file, (uploadedFilename) => {

        // Success callback...

    }, () => {

        // Error callback...

    }, (event) => {

        // Progress callback...

        // event.detail.progress contains a number between 1 and 100 as the upload progresses

    }, () => {

        // Cancelled callback...

    })

 

    // Upload multiple files...

    $wire.uploadMultiple('photos', [file], successCallback, errorCallback, progressCallback, cancelledCallback)

 

    // Remove single file from multiple uploaded files...

    $wire.removeUpload('photos', uploadedFilename, successCallback)

 

    // Cancel an upload...

    $wire.cancelUpload('photos')

</script>


```


## [#](#configuration "Permalink")Configuration

Because Livewire stores all file uploads temporarily before the developer can validate or store them, it assumes some default handling behavior for all file uploads.

### [#](#global-validation "Permalink")Global validation

By default, Livewire will validate all temporary file uploads with the following rules: `file|max:12288` (Must be a file less than 12MB).

If you wish to customize these rules, you can do so inside your application's `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'temporary_file_upload' => [

    // ...

    'rules' => 'file|mimes:png,jpg,pdf|max:102400', // (100MB max, and only accept PNGs, JPEGs, and PDFs)

],


```


### [#](#global-middleware "Permalink")Global middleware

The temporary file upload endpoint is assigned a throttling middleware by default. You can customize exactly what middleware this endpoint uses via the following configuration option:

```
'temporary_file_upload' => [

    // ...

    'middleware' => 'throttle:5,1', // Only allow 5 uploads per user per minute

],


```


### [#](#temporary-upload-directory "Permalink")Temporary upload directory

Temporary files are uploaded to the specified disk's `livewire-tmp/` directory. You can customize this directory via the following configuration option:

```
'temporary_file_upload' => [

    // ...

    'directory' => 'tmp',

],


```

# 0021_Pagination

# Pagination

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Laravel's pagination feature allows you to query a subset of data and provides your users with the ability to navigate between *pages* of those results.

Because Laravel's paginator was designed for static applications, in a non-Livewire app, each page navigation triggers a full browser visit to a new URL containing the desired page (`?page=2`).

However, when you use pagination inside a Livewire component, users can navigate between pages while remaining on the same page. Livewire will handle everything behind the scenes, including updating the URL query string with the current page.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Below is the most basic example of using pagination inside a `show-posts` component to only show ten posts at a time:

You must use the`WithPagination` trait

To take advantage of Livewire's pagination features, each component containing pagination must use the `Livewire\WithPagination` trait.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-posts.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithPagination;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::paginate(10);

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <div>

        @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

            <!-- ... -->

        @endforeach

    </div>

 

    {{ $this->posts->links() }}

</div>


```
As you can see, in addition to limiting the number of posts shown via the `Post::paginate()` method, we will also use `$this->posts->links()` to render page navigation links.

For more information on pagination using Laravel, check out [Laravel's comprehensive pagination documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination).

## [#](#disabling-url-query-string-tracking "Permalink")Disabling URL query string tracking

By default, Livewire's paginator tracks the current page in the browser URL's query string like so: `?page=2`.

If you wish to still use Livewire's pagination utility, but disable query string tracking, you can do so using the `WithoutUrlPagination` trait:

```
use Livewire\WithoutUrlPagination;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowPosts extends Component

{

    use WithPagination, WithoutUrlPagination;

 

    // ...

}


```
Now, pagination will work as expected, but the current page won't show up in the query string. This also means the current page won't be persisted across page changes.

## [#](#customizing-scroll-behavior "Permalink")Customizing scroll behavior

By default, Livewire's paginator scrolls to the top of the page after every page change.

You can disable this behavior by passing `false` to the `scrollTo` parameter of the `links()` method like so:

```
{{ $posts->links(data: ['scrollTo' => false]) }}


```
Alternatively, you can provide any CSS selector to the `scrollTo` parameter, and Livewire will find the nearest element matching that selector and scroll to it after each navigation:

```
{{ $posts->links(data: ['scrollTo' => '#paginated-posts']) }}


```


## [#](#resetting-the-page "Permalink")Resetting the page

When sorting or filtering results, it is common to want to reset the page number back to `1`.

For this reason, Livewire provides the `$this->resetPage()` method, allowing you to reset the page number from anywhere in your component.

The following component demonstrates using this method to reset the page after the search form is submitted:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡search-posts.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithPagination;

 

    public $query = '';

 

    public function search()

    {

        $this->resetPage();

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::where('title', 'like', '%'.$this->query.'%')->paginate(10);

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <form wire:submit="search">

        <input type="text" wire:model="query">

 

        <button type="submit">Search posts</button>

    </form>

 

    <div>

        @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

            <!-- ... -->

        @endforeach

    </div>

 

    {{ $this->posts->links() }}

</div>


```
Now, if a user was on page `5` of the results and then filtered the results further by pressing "Search posts", the page would be reset back to `1`.

### [#](#available-page-navigation-methods "Permalink")Available page navigation methods

In addition to `$this->resetPage()`, Livewire provides other useful methods for navigating between pages programmatically from your component:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$this->setPage($page)` | Set the paginator to a specific page number |
| `$this->resetPage()` | Reset the page back to 1 |
| `$this->nextPage()` | Go to the next page |
| `$this->previousPage()` | Go to the previous page |


## [#](#multiple-paginators "Permalink")Multiple paginators

Because both Laravel and Livewire use URL query string parameters to store and track the current page number, if a single page contains multiple paginators, it's important to assign them different names.

To demonstrate the problem more clearly, consider the following `show-clients` component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-clients.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Client;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithPagination;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function clients()

    {

        return Client::paginate(10);

    }

};


```
As you can see, the above component contains a paginated set of *clients*. If a user were to navigate to page `2` of this result set, the URL might look like the following:

```
http://application.test/?page=2


```
Suppose the page also contains a `show-invoices` component that also uses pagination. To independently track each paginator's current page, you need to specify a name for the second paginator like so:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-invoices.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Invoice;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithPagination;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function invoices()

    {

        return Invoice::paginate(10, pageName: 'invoices-page');

    }

};


```
Now, because of the `pageName` parameter that has been added to the `paginate` method, when a user visits page `2` of the *invoices*, the URL will contain the following:

```
https://application.test/customers?page=2&invoices-page=2


```
When using Livewire's page navigation methods on a named paginator, you must provide the page name as an additional parameter:

```
$this->setPage(2, pageName: 'invoices-page');

 

$this->resetPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');

 

$this->nextPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');

 

$this->previousPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');


```


## [#](#hooking-into-page-updates "Permalink")Hooking into page updates

Livewire allows you to execute code before and after a page is updated by defining either of the following methods inside your component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-posts.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\WithPagination;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    use WithPagination;

 

    public function updatingPage($page)

    {

        // Runs before the page is updated for this component...

    }

 

    public function updatedPage($page)

    {

        // Runs after the page is updated for this component...

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::paginate(10);

    }

};


```


### [#](#named-paginator-hooks "Permalink")Named paginator hooks

The previous hooks only apply to the default paginator. If you are using a named paginator, you must define the methods using the paginator's name.

For example, below is an example of what a hook for a paginator named `invoices-page` would look like:

```
public function updatingInvoicesPage($page)

{

    //

}


```


### [#](#general-paginator-hooks "Permalink")General paginator hooks

If you prefer to not reference the paginator name in the hook method name, you can use the more generic alternatives and simply receive the `$pageName` as a second argument to the hook method:

```
public function updatingPaginators($page, $pageName)

{

    // Runs before the page is updated for this component...

}

 

public function updatedPaginators($page, $pageName)

{

    // Runs after the page is updated for this component...

}


```


## [#](#using-the-simple-theme "Permalink")Using the simple theme

You can use Laravel's `simplePaginate()` method instead of `paginate()` for added speed and simplicity.

When paginating results using this method, only *next* and *previous* navigation links will be shown to the user instead of individual links for each page number:

```
public function render()

{

    return view('show-posts', [

        'posts' => Post::simplePaginate(10),

    ]);

}


```
For more information on simple pagination, check out [Laravel's "simplePaginator" documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination#simple-pagination).

## [#](#using-cursor-pagination "Permalink")Using cursor pagination

Livewire also supports using Laravel's cursor pagination — a faster pagination method useful in large datasets:

```
public function render()

{

    return view('show-posts', [

        'posts' => Post::cursorPaginate(10),

    ]);

}


```
By using `cursorPaginate()` instead of `paginate()` or `simplePaginate()`, the query string in your application's URL will store an encoded *cursor* instead of a standard page number. For example:

```
https://example.com/posts?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTUsIl9wb2ludHNUb05leHRJdGVtcyI6dHJ1ZX0


```
For more information on cursor pagination, check out [Laravel's cursor pagination documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination#cursor-pagination).

## [#](#using-bootstrap-instead-of-tailwind "Permalink")Using Bootstrap instead of Tailwind

If you are using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) instead of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as your application's CSS framework, you can configure Livewire to use Bootstrap styled pagination views instead of the default Tailwind views.

To accomplish this, set the `pagination_theme` configuration value in your application's `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'pagination_theme' => 'bootstrap',


```


Publishing Livewire's configuration file

Before customizing the pagination theme, you must first publish Livewire's configuration file to your application's `/config` directory by running the following command:

```
php artisan livewire:config


```

## [#](#modifying-the-default-pagination-views "Permalink")Modifying the default pagination views

If you want to modify Livewire's pagination views to fit your application's style, you can do so by *publishing* them using the following command:

```
php artisan livewire:publish --pagination


```
After running this command, the following four files will be inserted into the `resources/views/vendor/livewire` directory:

| View file name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tailwind.blade.php` | The standard Tailwind pagination theme |
| `tailwind-simple.blade.php` | The *simple* Tailwind pagination theme |
| `bootstrap.blade.php` | The standard Bootstrap pagination theme |
| `bootstrap-simple.blade.php` | The *simple* Bootstrap pagination theme |


Once the files have been published, you have complete control over them. When rendering pagination links using the paginated result's `->links()` method inside your template, Livewire will use these files instead of its own.

## [#](#using-custom-pagination-views "Permalink")Using custom pagination views

If you wish to bypass Livewire's pagination views entirely, you can render your own in one of two ways:

1. The `->links()` method in your Blade view
2. The `paginationView()` or `paginationSimpleView()` method in your component


### [#](#via--links "Permalink")Via `->links()`

The first approach is to simply pass your custom pagination Blade view name to the `->links()` method directly:

```
{{ $posts->links('custom-pagination-links') }}


```
When rendering the pagination links, Livewire will now look for a view at `resources/views/custom-pagination-links.blade.php`.

### [#](#via-paginationview-or-paginationsimpleview "Permalink")Via `paginationView()` or `paginationSimpleView()`

The second approach is to declare a `paginationView` or `paginationSimpleView` method inside your component which returns the name of the view you would like to use:

```
public function paginationView()

{

    return 'custom-pagination-links-view';

}

 

public function paginationSimpleView()

{

    return 'custom-simple-pagination-links-view';

}


```


### [#](#sample-pagination-view "Permalink")Sample pagination view

Below is an unstyled sample of a simple Livewire pagination view for your reference.

As you can see, you can use Livewire's page navigation helpers like `$this->nextPage()` directly inside your template by adding `wire:click="nextPage"` to buttons:

```
<div>

    @if ($paginator->hasPages())

        <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination Navigation">

            <span>

                @if ($paginator->onFirstPage())

                    <span>Previous</span>

                @else

                    <button wire:click="previousPage" wire:loading.attr="disabled" rel="prev">Previous</button>

                @endif

            </span>

 

            <span>

                @if ($paginator->onLastPage())

                    <span>Next</span>

                @else

                    <button wire:click="nextPage" wire:loading.attr="disabled" rel="next">Next</button>

                @endif

            </span>

        </nav>

    @endif

</div>


```
For visual-only loading states (like opacity changes), you can use Livewire's automatic `data-loading` attribute with Tailwind classes instead:

```
<button wire:click="nextPage" class="data-loading:opacity-50" rel="next">

    Next

</button>


```

# 0022_URL Query Parameters

# URL Query Parameters

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to store component properties in the URL's query string. For example, you may want a `$search` property in your component to be included in the URL: `https://example.com/users?search=bob`. This is particularly useful for things like filtering, sorting, and pagination, as it allows users to share and bookmark specific states of a page.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Below is a `show-users` component that allows you to search users by their name via a simple text input:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-users.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $search = '';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function users()

    {

        return User::search($this->search)->get();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="search">

 

    <ul>

        @foreach ($this->users as $user)

            <li wire:key="{{ $user->id }}">{{ $user->name }}</li>

        @endforeach

    </ul>

</div>


```
As you can see, because the text input uses `wire:model.live="search"`, as a user types into the field, network requests will be sent to update the `$search` property and show a filtered set of users on the page.

However, if the visitor refreshes the page, the search value and results will be lost.

To preserve the search value across page loads so that a visitor can refresh the page or share the URL, we can store the search value in the URL's query string by adding the `#[Url]` attribute above the `$search` property like so:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-users.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url]

    public $search = '';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function users()

    {

        return User::search($this->search)->get();

    }

};


```
Now, if a user types "bob" into the search field, the URL bar in the browser will show:

```
https://example.com/users?search=bob


```
If they now load this URL from a new browser window, "bob" will be filled in the search field, and the user results will be filtered accordingly.

## [#](#initializing-properties-from-the-url "Permalink")Initializing properties from the URL

As you saw in the previous example, when a property uses `#[Url]`, not only does it store its updated value in the query string of the URL, it also references any existing query string values on page load.

For example, if a user visits the URL `https://example.com/users?search=bob`, Livewire will set the initial value of `$search` to "bob".

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url]

    public $search = ''; // Will be set to "bob"...

 

    // ...

}


```


### [#](#nullable-properties "Permalink")Nullable properties

By default, if a page is loaded with an empty query string entry like `?search=`, Livewire will treat that value as an empty string. In many cases, this is expected, however there are times when you want `?search=` to be treated as `null`.

In these cases, you can use a nullable typehint like so:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url]

    public ?string $search;

 

    // ...

}


```
Because `?` is present in the above typehint, Livewire will see `?search=` and set `$search` to `null` instead of an empty string.

This works the other way around as well, if you set `$this->search = null` in your application, it will be represented in the query string as `?search=`.

## [#](#using-an-alias "Permalink")Using an alias

Livewire gives you full control over what name displays in the URL's query string. For example, you may have a `$search` property but want to either obfuscate the actual property name or shorten it to `q`.

You can specify a query string alias by providing the `as` parameter to the `#[Url]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url(as: 'q')]

    public $search = '';

 

    // ...

}


```
Now, when a user types "bob" into the search field, the URL will show: `https://example.com/users?q=bob` instead of `?search=bob`.

## [#](#excluding-certain-values "Permalink")Excluding certain values

By default, Livewire will only put an entry in the query string when it's value has changed from what it was at initialization. Most of the time, this is the desired behavior, however, there are certain scenarios where you may want more control over which value Livewire excludes from the query string. In these cases you can use the `except` parameter.

For example, in the component below, the initial value of `$search` is modified in `mount()`. To ensure the browser will only ever exclude `search` from the query string if the `search` value is an empty string, the `except` parameter has been added to `#[Url]`:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url(except: '')]

    public $search = '';

 

    public function mount() {

        $this->search = auth()->user()->username;

    }

 

    // ...

}


```
Without `except` in the above example, Livewire would remove the `search` entry from the query string any time the value of `search` is equal to the initial value of `auth()->user()->username`. Instead, because `except: ''` has been used, Livewire will preserve all query string values except when `search` is an empty string.

## [#](#display-on-page-load "Permalink")Display on page load

By default, Livewire will only display a value in the query string after the value has been changed on the page. For example, if the default value for `$search` is an empty string: `""`, when the actual search input is empty, no value will appear in the URL.

If you want the `?search` entry to always be included in the query string, even when the value is empty, you can provide the `keep` parameter to the `#[Url]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url(keep: true)]

    public $search = '';

 

    // ...

}


```
Now, when the page loads, the URL will be changed to the following: `https://example.com/users?search=`

## [#](#storing-in-history "Permalink")Storing in history

By default, Livewire uses [`history.replaceState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) to modify the URL instead of [`history.pushState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState). This means that when Livewire updates the query string, it modifies the current entry in the browser's history state instead of adding a new one.

Because Livewire "replaces" the current history, pressing the "back" button in the browser will go to the previous page rather than the previous `?search=` value.

To force Livewire to use `history.pushState` when updating the URL, you can provide the `history` parameter to the `#[Url]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    #[Url(history: true)]

    public $search = '';

 

    // ...

}


```
In the example above, when a user changes the search value from "bob" to "frank" and then clicks the browser's back button, the search value (and the URL) will be set back to "bob" instead of navigating to the previously visited page.

## [#](#using-the-querystring-method "Permalink")Using the queryString method

The query string can also be defined as a method on the component. This can be useful if some properties have dynamic options.

```
use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowUsers extends Component

{

    // ...

 

    protected function queryString()

    {

        return [

            'search' => [

                'as' => 'q',

            ],

        ];

    }

}


```


## [#](#trait-hooks "Permalink")Trait hooks

Livewire offers [hooks](/docs/4.x/lifecycle-hooks) for query strings as well.

```
trait WithSorting

{

    // ...

 

    protected function queryStringWithSorting()

    {

        return [

            'sortBy' => ['as' => 'sort'],

            'sortDirection' => ['as' => 'direction'],

        ];

    }

}

# 0023_Computed Properties

# Computed Properties

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Computed properties are a way to create "derived" properties in Livewire. Like accessors on an Eloquent model, computed properties allow you to access values and memoize them for future access during the request.

Computed properties are particularly useful in combination with component's public properties.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

To create a computed property, you can add the `#[Computed]` attribute above any method in your Livewire component. Once the attribute has been added to the method, you can access it like any other property.

Make sure you import attribute classes

Make sure you import any attribute classes. For example, the below `#[Computed]` attribute requires the following import `use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;`.

For example, here's a `show-user` component that uses a computed property named `user()` to access a `User` Eloquent model based on a property named `$userId`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-user.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $userId;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function user()

    {

        return User::find($this->userId);

    }

 

    public function follow()

    {

        Auth::user()->follow($this->user);

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $this->user->name }}</h1>

 

    <span>{{ $this->user->email }}</span>

 

    <button wire:click="follow">Follow</button>

</div>


```
Because the `#[Computed]` attribute has been added to the `user()` method, the value is accessible in other methods in the component and within the Blade template.

Must use`$this` in your template

Unlike normal properties, computed properties aren't directly available inside your component's template. Instead, you must access them on the `$this` object. For example, a computed property named `posts()` must be accessed via `$this->posts` inside your template.

Computed properties are not supported on`Livewire\Form` objects.

Trying to use a Computed property within a [Form](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/forms) will result in an error when you attempt to access the property in blade using $form->property syntax.

## [#](#performance-advantage "Permalink")Performance advantage

You may be asking yourself: why use computed properties at all? Why not just call the method directly?

Accessing a method as a computed property offers a performance advantage over calling a method. Internally, when a computed property is executed for the first time, Livewire memoizes the returned value. This way, any subsequent accesses in the request will return the memoized value instead of executing multiple times.

This allows you to freely access a derived value and not worry about the performance implications.

Computed properties are only memoized for a single request

It's a common misconception that Livewire memoizes computed properties for the entire lifespan of your Livewire component on a page. However, this isn't the case. Instead, Livewire only memoizes the result for the duration of a single component request (it does not persist between requests). This means that if your computed property method contains an expensive database query, it will be executed every time your Livewire component performs an update.

### [#](#clearing-the-memo "Permalink")Clearing the memo

Consider the following problematic scenario:

1. You access a computed property that depends on a certain property or database state
2. The underlying property or database state changes
3. The memoized value for the property becomes stale and needs to be re-computed


To clear, or "bust", the stored memo, you can use PHP's `unset()` function.

Below is an example of an action called `createPost()` that, by creating a new post in the application, makes the `posts()` computed stale — meaning the computed property `posts()` needs to be re-computed to include the newly added post:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-posts.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function createPost()

    {

        if ($this->posts->count() > 10) {

            throw new \Exception('Maximum post count exceeded');

        }

 

        Auth::user()->posts()->create(...);

 

        unset($this->posts);

    }

 

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
In the above component, the computed property is memoized before a new post is created because the `createPost()` method accesses `$this->posts` before the new post is created. To ensure that `$this->posts` contains the most up-to-date contents when accessed inside the view, the memo is cleared using `unset($this->posts)`.

### [#](#caching-between-requests "Permalink")Caching between requests

Memoization vs Caching

The memoization we've discussed so far only lasts for a single request. If you need values to persist across multiple requests, you need actual Laravel caching.

Sometimes you would like to cache the value of a computed property for the lifespan of a Livewire component, rather than it being cleared after every request. In these cases, you can use [Laravel's caching utilities](https://laravel.com/docs/cache#retrieve-store).

Below is an example of a computed property named `user()`, where instead of executing the Eloquent query directly, we wrap the query in `Cache::remember()` to ensure that any future requests retrieve it from Laravel's cache instead of re-executing the query:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-user.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $userId;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function user()

    {

        $key = 'user'.$this->getId();

        $seconds = 3600; // 1 hour...

 

        return Cache::remember($key, $seconds, function () {

            return User::find($this->userId);

        });

    }

 

    // ...

};


```
Because each unique instance of a Livewire component has a unique ID, we can use `$this->getId()` to generate a unique cache key that will only be applied to future requests for this same component instance.

But, as you may have noticed, most of this code is predictable and can easily be abstracted. Because of this, Livewire's `#[Computed]` attribute provides a helpful `persist` parameter. By applying `#[Computed(persist: true)]` to a method, you can achieve the same result without any extra code:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\User;

 

#[Computed(persist: true)]

public function user()

{

    return User::find($this->userId);

}


```
In the example above, when `$this->user` is accessed from your component, it will continue to be cached for the duration of the Livewire component on the page. This means the actual Eloquent query will only be executed once.

Livewire caches persisted values for 3600 seconds (one hour). You can override this default by passing an additional `seconds` parameter to the `#[Computed]` attribute:

```
#[Computed(persist: true, seconds: 7200)]


```


Calling`unset()` will clear both memo and cache

As previously discussed, you can clear a computed property's memo using PHP's `unset()` method. This also applies to computed properties using the `persist: true` parameter. When calling `unset()` on a persisted computed property, Livewire will clear not only the in-request memo, but also the underlying cached value in Laravel's cache.

## [#](#caching-across-all-components "Permalink")Caching across all components

Instead of caching the value of a computed property for the duration of a single component's lifecycle, you can cache the value of a computed across all components in your application using the `cache: true` parameter provided by the `#[Computed]` attribute:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\Post;

 

#[Computed(cache: true)]

public function posts()

{

    return Post::all();

}


```
In the above example, until the cache expires or is busted, every instance of this component in your application will share the same cached value for `$this->posts`.

If you need to manually clear the cache for a computed property, you may set a custom cache key using the `key` parameter:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\Post;

 

#[Computed(cache: true, key: 'homepage-posts')]

public function posts()

{

    return Post::all();

}


```


## [#](#when-to-use-computed-properties "Permalink")When to use computed properties?

In addition to offering performance advantages, there are a few other scenarios where computed properties are helpful.

Specifically, when passing data into your component's Blade template, there are a few occasions where a computed property is a better alternative. Below is an example of a simple component's `render()` method passing a collection of `posts` to a Blade template:

```
public function render()

{

    return view('livewire.show-posts', [

        'posts' => Post::all(),

    ]);

}


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <!-- ... -->

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Although this is sufficient for many use cases, here are three scenarios where a computed property would be a better alternative:

### [#](#conditionally-accessing-values "Permalink")Conditionally accessing values

If you are conditionally accessing a value that is computationally expensive to retrieve in your Blade template, you can reduce performance overhead using a computed property.

Consider the following template without a computed property:

```
<div>

    @if (Auth::user()->can_see_posts)

        @foreach ($posts as $post)

            <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

                <!-- ... -->

            </div>

        @endforeach

    @endif

</div>


```
If a user is restricted from viewing posts, the database query to retrieve the posts has already been made, yet the posts are never used in the template.

Here's a version of the above scenario using a computed property instead:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\Post;

 

#[Computed]

public function posts()

{

    return Post::all();

}

 

public function render()

{

    return view('livewire.show-posts');

}


```

```
<div>

    @if (Auth::user()->can_see_posts)

        @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

            <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

                <!-- ... -->

            </div>

        @endforeach

    @endif

</div>


```
Now, because we are providing the posts to the template using a computed property, we only execute the database query when the data is needed.

### [#](#using-inline-templates "Permalink")Using inline templates

Another scenario when computed properties are helpful is using [inline templates](/docs/4.x/components#inline-components) in your component.

Below is an example of an inline component where, because we are returning a template string directly inside `render()`, we never have an opportunity to pass data into the view:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-posts.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::all();

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return <<<HTML

        <div>

            @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

                <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

                    <!-- ... -->

                </div>

            @endforeach

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

};


```
In the above example, without a computed property, we would have no way to explicitly pass data into the Blade template.

### [#](#omitting-the-render-method "Permalink")Omitting the render method

In Livewire, another way to cut down on boilerplate in your components is by omitting the `render()` method entirely. When omitted, Livewire will use its own `render()` method returning the corresponding Blade view by convention.

In these case, you obviously don't have a `render()` method from which you can pass data into a Blade view.

Rather than re-introducing the `render()` method into your component, you can instead provide that data to the view via computed properties:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-posts.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::all();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <!-- ... -->

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```


## [#](#alternative-session-properties "Permalink")Alternative: Session properties

If you need to persist simple values across page refreshes without cross-request caching, consider using the [`#[Session]` attribute](/docs/4.x/attribute-session) instead of computed properties.

Session properties are useful when:

- You want user-specific values to persist across page reloads (like search filters or UI preferences)
- You don't need the value to be shareable via URL
- The value is simple and not computationally expensive to store


For example, storing a search query in the session:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Session;

 

#[Session]

public $search = '';


```
This keeps the search value across page refreshes without using URL parameters or computed property caching.

# 0024_Redirecting

# Redirecting

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

After a user performs some action — like submitting a form — you may want to redirect them to another page in your application.

Because Livewire requests aren't standard full-page browser requests, standard HTTP redirects won't work. Instead, you need to trigger redirects via JavaScript. Fortunately, Livewire exposes a simple `$this->redirect()` helper method to use within your components. Internally, Livewire will handle the process of redirecting on the frontend.

If you prefer, you can use [Laravel's built-in redirect utilities](https://laravel.com/docs/responses#redirects) within your components as well.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Below is an example of a `post.create` Livewire component that redirects the user to another page after they submit the form to create a post:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};

?>

 

<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- Form fields... -->

</form>


```
As you can see, when the `save` action is triggered, a redirect will also be triggered to `/posts`. When Livewire receives this response, it will redirect the user to the new URL on the frontend.

## [#](#redirect-to-route "Permalink")Redirect to Route

In case you want to redirect to a page using its route name you can use the `redirectRoute`.

For example, if you have a page with the route named `'profile'` like this:

```
Route::get('/user/profile', function () {

    // ...

})->name('profile');


```
You can use `redirectRoute` to redirect to that page using the name of the route like so:

```
$this->redirectRoute('profile');


```
In case you need to pass parameters to the route you may use the second argument of the method `redirectRoute` like so:

```
$this->redirectRoute('profile', ['id' => 1]);


```


## [#](#redirect-to-intended "Permalink")Redirect to intended

In case you want to redirect the user back to the previous page they were on you can use `redirectIntended`. It accepts an optional default URL as its first argument which is used as a fallback if no previous page can be determined:

```
$this->redirectIntended('/default/url');


```


## [#](#redirecting-to-full-page-components "Permalink")Redirecting to full-page components

Because Livewire uses Laravel's built-in redirection feature, you can use all of the redirection methods available to you in a typical Laravel application.

For example, if you are using a Livewire component as a full-page component for a route like so:

```
Route::livewire('/posts', 'pages::show-posts');


```
You can redirect to it simply by using the route path:

```
public function save()

{

    // ...

 

    $this->redirect('/posts');

}


```


## [#](#redirect-to-controller-actions "Permalink")Redirect to controller actions

If you want to redirect to a route handled by a controller action, you can use `redirectAction()`:

```
$this->redirectAction([UserController::class, 'index']);


```
You can pass parameters to the controller action as the second argument:

```
$this->redirectAction([UserController::class, 'show'], ['id' => 1]);


```


## [#](#flash-messages "Permalink")Flash messages

In addition to allowing you to use Laravel's built-in redirection methods, Livewire also supports Laravel's [session flash data utilities](https://laravel.com/docs/session#flash-data).

To pass flash data along with a redirect, you can use Laravel's `session()->flash()` method like so:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    // ...

 

    public function update()

    {

        // ...

 

        session()->flash('status', 'Post successfully updated.');

 

        $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

};

?>


```
Assuming the page being redirected to contain the following Blade snippet, the user will see a "Post successfully updated." message after updating the post:

```
@if (session('status'))

    <div class="alert alert-success">

        {{ session('status') }}

    </div>

@endif


```

# 0025_File Downloads

# File Downloads

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

File downloads in Livewire work much the same as in Laravel itself. Typically, you can use any Laravel download utility inside a Livewire component, and it should work as expected.

However, behind the scenes, file downloads are handled differently than in a standard Laravel application. When using Livewire, the file's contents are Base64 encoded, sent to the frontend, and decoded back into binary to be downloaded directly from the client.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Triggering a file download in Livewire is as simple as returning a standard Laravel download response.

Below is an example of a `show-invoice` component that contains a "Download" button to download the invoice PDF:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡show-invoice.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Invoice;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Invoice $invoice;

 

    public function mount(Invoice $invoice)

    {

        $this->invoice = $invoice;

    }

 

    public function download()

    {

        return response()->download(

            $this->invoice->file_path, 'invoice.pdf'

        );

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $invoice->title }}</h1>

 

    <span>{{ $invoice->date }}</span>

    <span>{{ $invoice->amount }}</span>

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="download">Download</button>

</div>


```
Just like in a Laravel controller, you can also use the `Storage` facade to initiate downloads:

```
public function download()

{

    return Storage::disk('invoices')->download('invoice.csv');

}


```


## [#](#streaming-downloads "Permalink")Streaming downloads

Livewire can also stream downloads; however, they aren't truly streamed. The download isn't triggered until the file's contents are collected and delivered to the browser:

```
public function download()

{

    return response()->streamDownload(function () {

        echo '...'; // Echo download contents directly...

    }, 'invoice.pdf');

}


```


## [#](#testing-file-downloads "Permalink")Testing file downloads

Livewire also provides a `->assertFileDownloaded()` method to easily test that a file was downloaded with a given name:

```
use App\Models\Invoice;

 

public function test_can_download_invoice()

{

    $invoice = Invoice::factory();

 

    Livewire::test(ShowInvoice::class)

        ->call('download')

        ->assertFileDownloaded('invoice.pdf');

}


```
You can also test to ensure a file was not downloaded using the `->assertNoFileDownloaded()` method:

```
use App\Models\Invoice;

 

public function test_does_not_download_invoice_if_unauthorised()

{

    $invoice = Invoice::factory();

 

    Livewire::test(ShowInvoice::class)

        ->call('download')

        ->assertNoFileDownloaded();

}


```




# 0026_Teleport

# Teleport

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to *teleport* part of your template to another part of the DOM on the page entirely.

This is useful for things like nested dialogs. When nesting one dialog inside of another, the z-index of the parent modal is applied to the nested modal. This can cause problems with styling backdrops and overlays. To avoid this problem, you can use Livewire's `@teleport` directive to render each nested modal as siblings in the rendered DOM.

This functionality is powered by [Alpine's `x-teleport` directive](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/teleport).

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

To *teleport* a portion of your template to another part of the DOM, you can wrap it in Livewire's `@teleport` directive.

Below is an example of using `@teleport` to render a modal dialog's contents at the end of the `<body>` element on the page:

```
<div>

    <!-- Modal -->

    <div x-data="{ open: false }">

        <button @click="open = ! open">Toggle Modal</button>

 

        @teleport('body')

            <div x-show="open">

                Modal contents...

            </div>

        @endteleport

    </div>

</div>


```


The `@teleport` selector can be any string you would normally pass into something like `document.querySelector()`.

You can learn more about `document.querySelector()` by consulting its [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).

Now, when the above Livewire template is rendered on the page, the *contents* portion of the modal will be rendered at the end of `<body>`:

```
<body>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <div x-show="open">

        Modal contents...

    </div>

</body>


```


You must teleport outside the component

Livewire only supports teleporting HTML outside your components. For example, teleporting a modal to the `<body>` tag is fine, but teleporting it to another element within your component will not work.

Teleporting only works with a single root element

Make sure you only include a single root element inside your `@teleport` statement.




# 0027_wirebind

# wire:bind

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

`wire:bind` is a directive that dynamically binds HTML attributes to component properties or expressions. Unlike using Blade's attribute syntax, `wire:bind` updates the attribute reactively on the client without requiring a full re-render.

If you are familiar with Alpine's `x-bind` directive, the two are essentially the same.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

```
<input wire:model="message" wire:bind:class="message.length > 240 && 'text-red-500'">


```
As the user types, `wire:bind:class` reacts to the message length and applies the class instantly on the client.

# 0028_wireclick

# wire:click

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire provides a simple `wire:click` directive for calling component methods (aka actions) when a user clicks a specific element on the page.

For example, given the `ShowInvoice` component below:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Invoice;

 

class ShowInvoice extends Component

{

    public Invoice $invoice;

 

    public function download()

    {

        return response()->download(

            $this->invoice->file_path, 'invoice.pdf'

        );

    }

}


```
You can trigger the `download()` method from the class above when a user clicks a "Download Invoice" button by adding `wire:click="download"`:

```
<button type="button" wire:click="download">

    Download Invoice

</button>


```


## [#](#passing-parameters "Permalink")Passing parameters

You can pass parameters to actions directly in the `wire:click` directive:

```
<button wire:click="delete({{ $post->id }})">Delete</button>


```
When the button is clicked, the `delete()` method will be called with the post's ID.

Don't trust action parameters

Action parameters should be treated like HTTP request input and should not be trusted. Always authorize ownership before updating data.

## [#](#using-on-links "Permalink")Using on links

When using `wire:click` on `<a>` tags, you must append `.prevent` to prevent the default link behavior. Otherwise, the browser will navigate to the provided `href`.

```
<a href="#" wire:click.prevent="show">View Details</a>


```


## [#](#preventing-re-renders "Permalink")Preventing re-renders

Use `.renderless` to skip re-rendering the component after the action completes. This is useful for actions that only perform side effects (like logging or analytics):

```
<button wire:click.renderless="trackClick">Track Event</button>


```


## [#](#preserving-scroll-position "Permalink")Preserving scroll position

By default, updating content may change the scroll position. Use `.preserve-scroll` to maintain the current scroll position:

```
<button wire:click.preserve-scroll="loadMore">Load More</button>


```


## [#](#parallel-execution "Permalink")Parallel execution

By default, Livewire queues actions within the same component. Use `.async` to allow actions to run in parallel:

```
<button wire:click.async="process">Process</button>


```


## [#](#going-deeper "Permalink")Going deeper

The `wire:click` directive is just one of many different available event listeners in Livewire. For full documentation on its (and other event listeners) capabilities, visit [the Livewire actions documentation page](/docs/4.x/actions).

# 0029_wiresubmit

# wire:submit

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire makes it easy to handle form submissions via the `wire:submit` directive. By adding `wire:submit` to a `<form>` element, Livewire will intercept the form submission, prevent the default browser handling, and call any Livewire component method.

Here's a basic example of using `wire:submit` to handle a "Create Post" form submission:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        $this->redirect('/posts');

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.create-post');

    }

}


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

 

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
In the above example, when a user submits the form by clicking "Save", `wire:submit` intercepts the `submit` event and calls the `save()` action on the server.

Livewire automatically calls`preventDefault()`

`wire:submit` is different than other Livewire event handlers in that it internally calls `event.preventDefault()` without the need for the `.prevent` modifier. This is because there are very few instances you would be listening for the `submit` event and NOT want to prevent it's default browser handling (performing a full form submission to an endpoint).

Livewire automatically disables forms while submitting

By default, when Livewire is sending a form submission to the server, it will disable form submit buttons and mark all form inputs as `readonly`. This way a user cannot submit the same form again until the initial submission is complete.

## [#](#going-deeper "Permalink")Going deeper

`wire:submit` is just one of many event listeners that Livewire provides. The following two pages provide much more complete documentation on using `wire:submit` in your application:

# 0030_wiremodel

# wire:model

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire makes it easy to bind a component property's value with form inputs using `wire:model`.

Here is a simple example of using `wire:model` to bind the `$title` and `$content` properties with form inputs in a "Create Post" component:

```
use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $post = Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title

            'content' => $this->content

        ]);

 

        // ...

    }

}


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <label>

        <span>Title</span>

 

        <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    </label>

 

    <label>

        <span>Content</span>

 

        <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

    </label>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

</form>


```
Because both inputs use `wire:model`, their values will be synchronized with the server's properties when the "Save" button is pressed.

"Why isn't my component live updating as I type?"

If you tried this in your browser and are confused why the title isn't automatically updating, it's because Livewire only updates a component when an "action" is submitted—like pressing a submit button—not when a user types into a field. This cuts down on network requests and improves performance. To enable "live" updating as a user types, you can use `wire:model.live` instead. [Learn more about data binding](/docs/4.x/properties#data-binding).

## [#](#customizing-update-timing "Permalink")Customizing update timing

By default, Livewire will only send a network request when an action is performed (like `wire:click` or `wire:submit`), NOT when a `wire:model` input is updated.

This drastically improves the performance of Livewire by reducing network requests and provides a smoother experience for your users.

However, there are occasions where you may want to update the server more frequently for things like real-time validation.

### [#](#live-updating "Permalink")Live updating

To send property updates to the server as a user types into an input-field, you can append the `.live` modifier to `wire:model`:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live="title">


```


#### [#](#customizing-the-debounce "Permalink")Customizing the debounce

By default, when using `wire:model.live`, Livewire adds a 150 millisecond debounce to server updates. This means if a user is continually typing, Livewire will wait until the user stops typing for 150 milliseconds before sending a request.

You can customize this timing by appending `.debounce.Xms` after `.live`. Here is an example of changing the debounce to 250 milliseconds:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.live.debounce.250ms="title">


```


### [#](#updating-on-blur-event "Permalink")Updating on "blur" event

The `.blur` modifier delays syncing until the user clicks away from the input:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.blur="title">


```
To also send a network request on blur, add `.live`:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.blur.live="title">


```


### [#](#updating-on-change-event "Permalink")Updating on "change" event

The `.change` modifier triggers on the change event, which is useful for select elements:

```
<select wire:model.change="state">...</select>

 

<!-- With network request -->

<select wire:model.change.live="state">...</select>


```


### [#](#updating-on-enter-key "Permalink")Updating on "enter" key

The `.enter` modifier syncs when the user presses the Enter key:

```
<input type="text" wire:model.enter="search">

 

<!-- With network request -->

<input type="text" wire:model.enter.live="search">


```


## [#](#input-fields "Permalink")Input fields

Livewire supports most native input elements out of the box. Meaning you should just be able to attach `wire:model` to any input element in the browser and easily bind properties to them.

Here's a comprehensive list of the different available input types and how you use them in a Livewire context.

### [#](#text-inputs "Permalink")Text inputs

First and foremost, text inputs are the bedrock of most forms. Here's how to bind a property named "title" to one:

```
<input type="text" wire:model="title">


```


### [#](#textarea-inputs "Permalink")Textarea inputs

Textarea elements are similarly straightforward. Simply add `wire:model` to a textarea and the value will be bound:

```
<textarea type="text" wire:model="content"></textarea>


```
If the "content" value is initialized with a string, Livewire will fill the textarea with that value - there's no need to do something like the following:

```
<!-- Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do... -->

 

<textarea type="text" wire:model="content">{{ $content }}</textarea>


```


### [#](#checkboxes "Permalink")Checkboxes

Checkboxes can be used for single values, such as when toggling a boolean property. Or, checkboxes may be used to toggle a single value in a group of related values. We'll discuss both scenarios:

#### [#](#single-checkbox "Permalink")Single checkbox

At the end of a signup form, you might have a checkbox allowing the user to opt-in to email updates. You might call this property `$receiveUpdates`. You can easily bind this value to the checkbox using `wire:model`:

```
<input type="checkbox" wire:model="receiveUpdates">


```
Now when the `$receiveUpdates` value is `false`, the checkbox will be unchecked. Of course, when the value is `true`, the checkbox will be checked.

#### [#](#multiple-checkboxes "Permalink")Multiple checkboxes

Now, let's say in addition to allowing the user to decide to receive updates, you have an array property in your class called `$updateTypes`, allowing the user to choose from a variety of update types:

```
public $updateTypes = [];


```
By binding multiple checkboxes to the `$updateTypes` property, the user can select multiple update types and they will be added to the `$updateTypes` array property:

```
<input type="checkbox" value="email" wire:model="updateTypes">

<input type="checkbox" value="sms" wire:model="updateTypes">

<input type="checkbox" value="notification" wire:model="updateTypes">


```
For example, if the user checks the first two boxes but not the third, the value of `$updateTypes` will be: `["email", "sms"]`

### [#](#radio-buttons "Permalink")Radio buttons

To toggle between two different values for a single property, you may use radio buttons:

```
<input type="radio" value="yes" wire:model="receiveUpdates">

<input type="radio" value="no" wire:model="receiveUpdates">


```


### [#](#select-dropdowns "Permalink")Select dropdowns

Livewire makes it simple to work with `<select>` dropdowns. When adding `wire:model` to a dropdown, the currently selected value will be bound to the provided property name and vice versa.

In addition, there's no need to manually add `selected` to the option that will be selected - Livewire handles that for you automatically.

Below is an example of a select dropdown filled with a static list of states:

```
<select wire:model="state">

    <option value="AL">Alabama</option>

    <option value="AK">Alaska</option>

    <option value="AZ">Arizona</option>

    ...

</select>


```
When a specific state is selected, for example, "Alaska", the `$state` property on the component will be set to `AK`. If you would prefer the value to be set to "Alaska" instead of "AK", you can leave the `value=""` attribute off the `<option>` element entirely.

Often, you may build your dropdown options dynamically using Blade:

```
<select wire:model="state">

    @foreach (\App\Models\State::all() as $state)

        <option value="{{ $state->id }}">{{ $state->label }}</option>

    @endforeach

</select>


```
If you don't have a specific option selected by default, you may want to show a muted placeholder option by default, such as "Select a state":

```
<select wire:model="state">

    <option disabled value="">Select a state...</option>

 

    @foreach (\App\Models\State::all() as $state)

        <option value="{{ $state->id }}">{{ $state->label }}</option>

    @endforeach

</select>


```
As you can see, there is no "placeholder" attribute for a select menu like there is for text inputs. Instead, you have to add a `disabled` option element as the first option in the list.

### [#](#dependent-select-dropdowns "Permalink")Dependent select dropdowns

Sometimes you may want one select menu to be dependent on another. For example, a list of cities that changes based on which state is selected.

For the most part, this works as you'd expect, however there is one important gotcha: You must add a `wire:key` to the changing select so that Livewire properly refreshes its value when the options change.

Here's an example of two selects, one for states, one for cities. When the state select changes, the options in the city select will change properly:

```
<!-- States select menu... -->

<select wire:model.live="selectedState">

    @foreach (State::all() as $state)

        <option value="{{ $state->id }}">{{ $state->label }}</option>

    @endforeach

</select>

 

<!-- Cities dependent select menu... -->

<select wire:model.live="selectedCity" wire:key="{{ $selectedState }}">

    @foreach (City::whereStateId($selectedState->id)->get() as $city)

        <option value="{{ $city->id }}">{{ $city->label }}</option>

    @endforeach

</select>


```
Again, the only thing non-standard here is the `wire:key` that has been added to the second select. This ensures that when the state changes, the "selectedCity" value will be reset properly.

### [#](#multi-select-dropdowns "Permalink")Multi-select dropdowns

If you are using a "multiple" select menu, Livewire works as expected. In this example, states will be added to the `$states` array property when they are selected and removed if they are deselected:

```
<select wire:model="states" multiple>

    <option value="AL">Alabama</option>

    <option value="AK">Alaska</option>

    <option value="AZ">Arizona</option>

    ...

</select>


```


## [#](#event-propagation "Permalink")Event propagation

By default, `wire:model` only listens for input/change events that originate directly on the element itself, not events that bubble up from child elements. This prevents unexpected behavior when using `wire:model` on container elements like modals or accordions that contain other form inputs.

For example, if you have a modal with `wire:model="showModal"` and an input field inside it, clearing that input won't accidentally close the modal by bubbling up a change event.

### [#](#listening-to-child-events "Permalink")Listening to child events

In rare cases where you want `wire:model` to also respond to events bubbling up from child elements, you can use the `.deep` modifier:

```
<div wire:model.deep="value">

    <input type="text"> <!-- Changes here will update $value -->

</div>


```


Use`.deep` sparingly

Most use cases don't require listening to child events. Only use `.deep` when you specifically need to capture events from descendant elements.

# 0031_wireloading

# wire:loading

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Loading indicators are an important part of crafting good user interfaces. They give users visual feedback when a request is being made to the server, so they know they are waiting for a process to complete.

Consider using data-loading selectors instead

While `wire:loading` is great for simple show/hide scenarios, Livewire v4 introduces automatic `data-loading` attributes on elements that trigger network requests. This approach is often simpler and more flexible—you can style loading states directly with Tailwind without needing `wire:target` directives, and it works seamlessly even when dispatching events to other components. [Learn more about data-loading →](/docs/4.x/loading-states)

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Livewire provides a simple yet extremely powerful syntax for controlling loading indicators: `wire:loading`. Adding `wire:loading` to any element will hide it by default (using `display: none` in CSS) and show it when a request is sent to the server.

Below is a basic example of a `CreatePost` component's form with `wire:loading` being used to toggle a loading message:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

 

    <div wire:loading>

        Saving post...

    </div>

</form>


```
When a user presses "Save", the "Saving post..." message will appear below the button while the "save" action is being executed. The message will disappear when the response is received from the server and processed by Livewire.

### [#](#removing-elements "Permalink")Removing elements

Alternatively, you can append `.remove` for the inverse effect, showing an element by default and hiding it during requests to the server:

```
<div wire:loading.remove>...</div>


```


## [#](#toggling-classes "Permalink")Toggling classes

In addition to toggling the visibility of entire elements, it's often useful to change the styling of an existing element by toggling CSS classes on and off during requests to the server. This technique can be used for things like changing background colors, lowering opacity, triggering spinning animations, and more.

Below is a simple example of using the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) class `opacity-50` to make the "Save" button fainter while the form is being submitted:

```
<button wire:loading.class="opacity-50">Save</button>


```
Like toggling an element, you can perform the inverse class operation by appending `.remove` to the `wire:loading` directive. In the example below, the button's `bg-blue-500` class will be removed when the "Save" button is pressed:

```
<button class="bg-blue-500" wire:loading.class.remove="bg-blue-500">

    Save

</button>


```


## [#](#toggling-attributes "Permalink")Toggling attributes

By default, when a form is submitted, Livewire will automatically disable the submit button and add the `readonly` attribute to each input element while the form is being processed.

However, in addition to this default behavior, Livewire offers the `.attr` modifier to allow you to toggle other attributes on an element or toggle attributes on elements that are outside of forms:

```
<button

    type="button"

    wire:click="remove"

    wire:loading.attr="disabled"

>

    Remove

</button>


```
Because the button above isn't a submit button, it won't be disabled by Livewire's default form handling behavior when pressed. Instead, we manually added `wire:loading.attr="disabled"` to achieve this behavior.

## [#](#targeting-specific-actions "Permalink")Targeting specific actions

By default, `wire:loading` will be triggered whenever a component makes a request to the server.

However, in components with multiple elements that can trigger server requests, you should scope your loading indicators down to individual actions.

For example, consider the following "Save post" form. In addition to a "Save" button that submits the form, there might also be a "Remove" button that executes a "remove" action on the component.

By adding `wire:target` to the following `wire:loading` element, you can instruct Livewire to only show the loading message when the "Remove" button is clicked:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="remove">Remove</button>

 

    <div wire:loading wire:target="remove">

        Removing post...

    </div>

</form>


```
When the above "Remove" button is pressed, the "Removing post..." message will be displayed to the user. However, the message will not be displayed when the "Save" button is pressed.

### [#](#targeting-multiple-actions "Permalink")Targeting multiple actions

You may find yourself in a situation where you would like `wire:loading` to react to some, but not all, actions on a page. In these cases you can pass multiple actions into `wire:target` separated by a comma. For example:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="title">

 

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

 

    <button type="button" wire:click="remove">Remove</button>

 

    <div wire:loading wire:target="save, remove">

        Updating post...

    </div>

</form>


```
The loading indicator ("Updating post...") will now only be shown when the "Remove" or "Save" button are pressed, and not when the `$title` field is being sent to the server.

### [#](#targeting-action-parameters "Permalink")Targeting action parameters

In situations where the same action is triggered with different parameters from multiple places on a page, you can further scope `wire:target` to a specific action by passing in additional parameters. For example, consider the following scenario where a "Remove" button exists for each post on the page:

```
<div>

    @foreach ($posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

            <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>

 

            <button wire:click="remove({{ $post->id }})">Remove</button>

 

            <div wire:loading wire:target="remove({{ $post->id }})">

                Removing post...

            </div>

        </div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Without passing `{{ $post->id }}` to `wire:target="remove"`, the "Removing post..." message would show when any of the buttons on the page are clicked.

However, because we are passing in unique parameters to each instance of `wire:target`, Livewire will only show the loading message when the matching parameters are passed to the "remove" action.

### [#](#targeting-property-updates "Permalink")Targeting property updates

Livewire also allows you to target specific component property updates by passing the property's name to the `wire:target` directive.

Consider the following example where a form input named `username` uses `wire:model.live` for real-time validation as a user types:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="username">

    @error('username') <span>{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <div wire:loading wire:target="username">

        Checking availability of username...

    </div>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```
The "Checking availability..." message will show when the server is updated with the new username as the user types into the input field.

### [#](#excluding-specific-loading-targets "Permalink")Excluding specific loading targets

Sometimes you may wish to display a loading indicator for every Livewire request *except* a specific property or action. In these cases you can use the `wire:target.except` modifier like so:

```
<div wire:loading wire:target.except="download">...</div>


```
The above loading indicator will now be shown for every Livewire update request on the component *except* the "download" action.

## [#](#customizing-css-display-property "Permalink")Customizing CSS display property

When `wire:loading` is added to an element, Livewire updates the CSS `display` property of the element to show and hide the element. By default, Livewire uses `none` to hide and `inline-block` to show.

If you are toggling an element that uses a display value other than `inline-block`, like `flex` in the following example, you can append `.flex` to `wire:loading`:

```
<div class="flex" wire:loading.flex>...</div>


```
Below is the complete list of available display values:

```
<div wire:loading.inline-flex>...</div>

<div wire:loading.inline>...</div>

<div wire:loading.block>...</div>

<div wire:loading.table>...</div>

<div wire:loading.flex>...</div>

<div wire:loading.grid>...</div>


```


## [#](#delaying-a-loading-indicator "Permalink")Delaying a loading indicator

On fast connections, updates often happen so quickly that loading indicators only flash briefly on the screen before being removed. In these cases, the indicator is more of a distraction than a helpful affordance.

For this reason, Livewire provides a `.delay` modifier to delay the showing of an indicator. For example, if you add `wire:loading.delay` to an element like so:

```
<div wire:loading.delay>...</div>


```
The above element will only appear if the request takes over 200 milliseconds. The user will never see the indicator if the request completes before then.

To customize the amount of time to delay the loading indicator, you can use one of Livewire's helpful interval aliases:

```
<div wire:loading.delay.shortest>...</div> <!-- 50ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay.shorter>...</div>  <!-- 100ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay.short>...</div>    <!-- 150ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay>...</div>          <!-- 200ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay.long>...</div>     <!-- 300ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay.longer>...</div>   <!-- 500ms -->

<div wire:loading.delay.longest>...</div>  <!-- 1000ms -->


```


## [#](#styling-with-data-loading "Permalink")Styling with data-loading

Livewire automatically adds a `data-loading` attribute to any element that triggers a network request. This allows you to style loading states directly with CSS or Tailwind without using `wire:loading` directives.

### [#](#using-tailwinds-data-attribute-variant "Permalink")Using Tailwind's data attribute variant

You can use Tailwind's `data-loading` variant to apply styles when an element is loading:

```
<button

    wire:click="save"

    class="data-loading:opacity-50 data-loading:pointer-events-none"

>

    Save Changes

</button>


```
When the button is clicked and the request is in-flight, it will automatically become semi-transparent and unclickable.

### [#](#using-css "Permalink")Using CSS

If you're not using Tailwind, you can target the `data-loading` attribute with standard CSS:

```
[data-loading] {

    opacity: 0.5;

    pointer-events: none;

}

 

button[data-loading] {

    background-color: #ccc;

    cursor: wait;

}


```


### [#](#styling-parent-and-child-elements "Permalink")Styling parent and child elements

You can style parent elements when a child has `data-loading` using the `has-data-loading:` variant:

```
<div class="has-data-loading:opacity-50">

    <button wire:click="save">Save</button>

</div>


```
Or style child elements from a parent with `data-loading` using the `in-data-loading:` variant:

```
<button wire:click="save">

    <span class="in-data-loading:hidden">Save</span>

    <span class="hidden in-data-loading:block">Saving...</span>

</button>


```

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire's `wire:navigate` feature makes page navigation much faster, providing an SPA-like experience for your users.

This page is a simple reference for the `wire:navigate` directive. Be sure to read the [page on Livewire's Navigate feature](/docs/4.x/navigate) for more complete documentation.

Below is a simple example of adding `wire:navigate` to links in a nav bar:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/" wire:navigate>Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" wire:navigate>Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" wire:navigate>Users</a>

</nav>


```
When any of these links are clicked, Livewire will intercept the click and, instead of allowing the browser to perform a full page visit, Livewire will fetch the page in the background and swap it with the current page (resulting in much faster and smoother page navigation).

## [#](#styling-active-links-with-data-current "Permalink")Styling active links with data-current

Livewire automatically adds a `data-current` attribute to any `wire:navigate` link that matches the current page URL. This allows you to style active navigation links using CSS or Tailwind without any additional directives:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold">Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold">Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" wire:navigate class="data-current:font-bold">Users</a>

</nav>


```
The `data-current` attribute is added and removed automatically as users navigate between pages. Read more about [highlighting active links in the Navigate documentation](/docs/4.x/navigate#using-the-data-current-attribute).

## [#](#prefetching-pages-on-hover "Permalink")Prefetching pages on hover

By adding the `.hover` modifier, Livewire will pre-fetch a page when a user hovers over a link. This way, the page will have already been downloaded from the server when the user clicks on the link.

```
<a href="/" wire:navigate.hover>Dashboard</a>


```

# 0033_wirecurrent

# wire:current

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `wire:current` directive allows you to easily detect and style currently active links on a page.

Consider using data-current instead

Livewire automatically adds a `data-current` attribute to all `wire:navigate` links that match the current page. You can style these links directly with Tailwind's `data-current:` variant or CSS, without needing the `wire:current` directive. [Learn more about automatic data-current →](/docs/4.x/navigate#using-the-data-current-attribute)

Here's a simple example of adding `wire:current` to links in a navbar so that the currently active link has a stronger font weight:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/dashboard" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Dashboard</a>

    <a href="/posts" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Posts</a>

    <a href="/users" ... wire:current="font-bold text-zinc-800">Users</a>

</nav>


```
Now when a user visits `/posts`, the "Posts" link will have a stronger font treatment than the other links.

You should note that `wire:current` works out of the box with `wire:navigate` links and page changes, and automatically adds the `data-current` attribute to matching links in addition to the specified classes.

## [#](#exact-matching "Permalink")Exact matching

By default, `wire:current` uses a partial matching strategy, meaning it will be applied if the link and current page share the beginning portion of the Url's path.

For example, if the link is `/posts`, and the current page is `/posts/1`, the `wire:current` directive will be applied.

If you wish to use exact matching, you can add the `.exact` modifier to the directive.

Here's an example where you might want to use exact matching to prevent the "Dashboard" link from being highlighted when the user visits `/posts`:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/" wire:current.exact="font-bold">Dashboard</a>

</nav>


```


## [#](#strict-matching "Permalink")Strict matching

By default, `wire:current` will remove trailing slashes (`/`) from its comparison.

If you'd like to disable this behavior and force a stract path string comparison, you can append the `.strict` modifier:

```
<nav>

    <a href="/posts/" wire:current.strict="font-bold">Dashboard</a>

</nav>


```


## [#](#troubleshooting "Permalink")Troubleshooting

If `wire:current` is not detecting the current link correctly, ensure the following:

- You have at least one Livewire component on the page, or have hardcoded `@livewireScripts` in your layout
- You have a `href` attribute on the link.


## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
wire:current="classes"


```


### [#](#modifiers "Permalink")Modifiers

# 0034_wirecloak

# wire:cloak

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

`wire:cloak` is a directive that hides elements on page load until Livewire is fully initialized. This is useful for preventing the "flash of unstyled content" that can occur when the page loads before Livewire has a chance to initialize.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

To use `wire:cloak`, add the directive to any element you want to hide during page load:

```
<div wire:cloak>

    This content will be hidden until Livewire is fully loaded

</div>


```


### [#](#dynamic-content "Permalink")Dynamic content

`wire:cloak` is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to prevent users from seeing uninitialized dynamic content such as element shown or hidden using `wire:show`.

```
<div>

    <div wire:show="starred" wire:cloak>

        <!-- Yellow star icon... -->

    </div>

 

    <div wire:show="!starred" wire:cloak>

        <!-- Gray star icon... -->

    </div>

</div>


```
In the above example, without `wire:cloak`, both icons would be shown before Livewire initializes. However, with `wire:cloak`, both elements will be hidden until initialization.

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

This directive has no modifiers.




# 0035_wiredirty

# wire:dirty

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

In a traditional HTML page containing a form, the form is only ever submitted when the user presses the "Submit" button.

However, Livewire is capable of much more than traditional form submissions. You can validate form inputs in real-time or even save the form as a user types.

In these "real-time" update scenarios, it can be helpful to signal to your users when a form or subset of a form has been changed, but hasn't been saved to the database.

When a form contains un-saved input, that form is considered "dirty". It only becomes "clean" when a network request has been triggered to synchronize the server state with the client-side state.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Livewire allows you to easily toggle visual elements on the page using the `wire:dirty` directive.

By adding `wire:dirty` to an element, you are instructing Livewire to only show the element when the client-side state diverges from the server-side state.

To demonstrate, here is an example of an `UpdatePost` form containing a visual "Unsaved changes..." indication that signals to the user that the form contains input that has not been saved:

```
<form wire:submit="update">

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

 

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <button type="submit">Update</button>

 

    <div wire:dirty>Unsaved changes...</div>

</form>


```
Because `wire:dirty` has been added to the "Unsaved changes..." message, the message will be hidden by default. Livewire will automatically display the message when the user starts modifying the form inputs.

When the user submits the form, the message will disappear again, since the server / client data is back in sync.

### [#](#removing-elements "Permalink")Removing elements

By adding the `.remove` modifier to `wire:dirty`, you can instead show an element by default and only hide it when the component has "dirty" state:

```
<div wire:dirty.remove>The data is in-sync...</div>


```


## [#](#targeting-property-updates "Permalink")Targeting property updates

Imagine you are using `wire:model.live.blur` to update a property on the server immediately after a user leaves an input field. In this scenario, you can provide a "dirty" indication for only that property by adding `wire:target` to the element that contains the `wire:dirty` directive.

Here is an example of only showing a dirty indication when the title property has been changed:

```
<form wire:submit="update">

    <input wire:model.live.blur="title">

 

    <div wire:dirty wire:target="title">Unsaved title...</div>

 

    <button type="submit">Update</button>

</form>


```


## [#](#toggling-classes "Permalink")Toggling classes

Often, instead of toggling entire elements, you may want to toggle individual CSS classes on an input when its state is "dirty".

Below is an example where a user types into an input field and the border becomes yellow, indicating an "unsaved" state. Then, when the user tabs away from the field, the border is removed, indicating that the state has been saved on the server:

```
<input wire:model.live.blur="title" wire:dirty.class="border-yellow-500">


```


## [#](#using-the-dirty-expression "Permalink")Using the `$dirty` expression

In addition to the `wire:dirty` directive, you can check dirty state programmatically using the `$dirty` expression in Livewire directives or `$wire.$dirty()` in Alpine.

### [#](#check-if-entire-component-is-dirty "Permalink")Check if entire component is dirty

To check if any property on the component has unsaved changes:

```
<div wire:show="$dirty">You have unsaved changes</div>


```


### [#](#check-if-a-specific-property-is-dirty "Permalink")Check if a specific property is dirty

To check if a specific property has been modified:

```
<div wire:show="$dirty('title')">Title has been modified</div>


```
You can also check nested properties:

```
<div wire:show="$dirty('user.name')">Name has been modified</div>


```


### [#](#conditional-logic-based-on-dirty-state "Permalink")Conditional logic based on dirty state

You can use `$wire.$dirty()` in Alpine to conditionally run logic:

```
<button x-on:click="$wire.$dirty('title') && $wire.save()">

    Save Title

</button>


```
Or apply conditional classes with Alpine:

```
<input

    wire:model="email"

    :class="$wire.$dirty('email') && 'border-yellow-500'"

>


```


## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
wire:dirty

wire:target="property"


```


### [#](#modifiers "Permalink")Modifiers

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.remove` | Show element by default, hide when dirty |
| `.class="class-name"` | Add a CSS class when dirty |


### [#](#dirty-expression "Permalink")`$dirty` expression

| Expression | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$dirty` | Returns `true` if any property has unsaved changes |
| `$dirty('property')` | Returns `true` if the specified property has unsaved changes |
| `$dirty(['title', 'description'])` | Returns `true` if any of the specified properties have unsaved changes |

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Before performing dangerous actions in Livewire, you may want to provide your users with some sort of visual confirmation.

Livewire makes this easy to do by adding `wire:confirm` in addition to any action (`wire:click`, `wire:submit`, etc.).

Here's an example of adding a confirmation dialog to a "Delete post" button:

```
<button

    type="button"

    wire:click="delete"

    wire:confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this post?"

>

    Delete post

</button>


```
When a user clicks "Delete post", Livewire will trigger a confirmation dialog (The default browser confirmation alert). If the user hits escape or presses cancel, the action won't be performed. If they press "OK", the action will be completed.

## [#](#prompting-users-for-input "Permalink")Prompting users for input

For even more dangerous actions such as deleting a user's account entirely, you may want to present them with a confirmation prompt which they would need to type in a specific string of characters to confirm the action.

Livewire provides a helpful `.prompt` modifier, that when applied to `wire:confirm`, it will prompt the user for input and only confirm the action if the input matches (case-sensitive) the provided string (designated by a "|" (pipe) character at the end if the `wire:confirm` value):

```
<button

    type="button"

    wire:click="delete"

    wire:confirm.prompt="Are you sure?\n\nType DELETE to confirm|DELETE"

>

    Delete account

</button>


```
When a user presses "Delete account", the action will only be performed if "DELETE" is entered into the prompt, otherwise, the action will be cancelled.

# 0037_wiretransition

# wire:transition

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

`wire:transition` enables smooth animations when elements appear, disappear, or change using the browser's native [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

Unlike JavaScript-based animation libraries, View Transitions are hardware-accelerated and handled natively by the browser, resulting in smoother animations with less overhead.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Add `wire:transition` to any element that may be added, removed, or changed during a Livewire update:

```
class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public Post $post;

 

    public $showComments = false;

}


```

```
<div>

    <button wire:click="$toggle('showComments')">Toggle comments</button>

 

    @if ($showComments)

        <div wire:transition>

            @foreach ($post->comments as $comment)

                <div>{{ $comment->body }}</div>

            @endforeach

        </div>

    @endif

</div>


```
When the comments appear or disappear, the browser will smoothly crossfade them instead of abruptly showing or hiding them.

## [#](#named-transitions "Permalink")Named transitions

By default, Livewire assigns the view-transition-name `match-element` to elements with `wire:transition`. You can provide a custom name to enable more advanced transition effects:

```
<div wire:transition="sidebar">...</div>


```
This sets the element's `view-transition-name` CSS property to `sidebar`, which you can target with CSS for custom animations.

## [#](#customizing-animations-with-css "Permalink")Customizing animations with CSS

View Transitions are controlled entirely through CSS. You can customize the animation by targeting the view-transition pseudo-elements:

```
/* Customize the transition for a specific element */

::view-transition-old(sidebar) {

    animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out;

}

 

::view-transition-new(sidebar) {

    animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in;

}

 

@keyframes slide-out {

    to { transform: translateX(-100%); }

}

 

@keyframes slide-in {

    from { transform: translateX(100%); }

}


```
The View Transitions API provides three pseudo-elements you can style:

- `::view-transition-old(name)` — The outgoing element's snapshot
- `::view-transition-new(name)` — The incoming element's snapshot
- `::view-transition-group(name)` — Container for both snapshots


## [#](#transition-types "Permalink")Transition types

For more complex scenarios like step wizards where you need different animations based on direction, you can use transition types. This allows you to animate "forward" and "backward" differently.

Use the `$this->transition()` method to set a transition type:

```
class Wizard extends Component

{

    public $step = 1;

 

    public function goToStep($step)

    {

        $this->transition(type: $step > $this->step ? 'forward' : 'backward');

 

        $this->step = $step;

    }

}


```
Then target the type in your CSS using the `:active-view-transition-type()` selector:

```

```
For methods that always transition in the same direction, you can use the `#[Transition]` attribute instead:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;

 

class Wizard extends Component

{

    public $step = 1;

 

    #[Transition(type: 'forward')]

    public function next()

    {

        $this->step++;

    }

 

    #[Transition(type: 'backward')]

    public function previous()

    {

        $this->step--;

    }

}


```


## [#](#skipping-transitions "Permalink")Skipping transitions

Sometimes you may want to disable transitions for specific actions—for example, a "reset" button that should instantly jump to the first step without animation.

Use `$this->skipTransition()` to disable transitions for the current request:

```
public function reset()

{

    $this->skipTransition();

 

    $this->step = 1;

}


```
Or use the `#[Transition]` attribute with `skip: true`:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;

 

#[Transition(skip: true)]

public function reset()

{

    $this->step = 1;

}


```


## [#](#respecting-reduced-motion "Permalink")Respecting reduced motion

Livewire automatically respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting. When enabled, transitions are disabled to avoid causing discomfort for users who are sensitive to motion.

## [#](#browser-support "Permalink")Browser support

View Transitions are supported in Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, and Safari 18+. In browsers that don't support View Transitions, elements will appear and disappear without animation—the functionality still works, just without the visual transition.

Firefox has limited support

Firefox 144+ supports basic view transitions, but does not support transition types.

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire offers a `wire:init` directive to run an action as soon as the component is rendered. This can be helpful in cases where you don't want to hold up the entire page load, but want to load some data immediately after the page load.

```
<div wire:init="loadPosts">

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
The `loadPosts` action will be run immediately after the Livewire component renders on the page.

In most cases however, [Livewire's lazy loading feature](/docs/4.x/lazy) is preferable to using `wire:init`.

# 0039_wireintersect

# wire:intersect

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire's `wire:intersect` directive allows you to execute an action when an element enters or leaves the viewport. This is useful for lazy loading content, triggering analytics, or creating scroll-based interactions.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

The simplest form runs an action when an element becomes visible:

```
<div wire:intersect="loadMore">

    <!-- Content loads when scrolled into view -->

</div>


```
When the element enters the viewport, the `loadMore` action will be called on your component.

## [#](#enter-and-leave-events "Permalink")Enter and leave events

You can specify whether to run the action on enter, leave, or both:

```
<!-- Runs when entering viewport (default) -->

<div wire:intersect="trackView">...</div>

 

<!-- Runs when entering viewport (explicit) -->

<div wire:intersect:enter="trackView">...</div>

 

<!-- Runs when leaving viewport -->

<div wire:intersect:leave="pauseVideo">...</div>


```


## [#](#visibility-modifiers "Permalink")Visibility modifiers

Control how much of the element needs to be visible before triggering:

```
<!-- Trigger when any part is visible (default) -->

<div wire:intersect="load">...</div>

 

<!-- Trigger when half is visible -->

<div wire:intersect.half="load">...</div>

 

<!-- Trigger when fully visible -->

<div wire:intersect.full="load">...</div>

 

<!-- Trigger at custom threshold (0-100) -->

<div wire:intersect.threshold.25="load">...</div>


```


## [#](#margin "Permalink")Margin

Add a margin around the viewport to trigger the action before/after the element enters:

```
<!-- Trigger 200px before entering viewport -->

<div wire:intersect.margin.200px="loadMore">...</div>

 

<!-- Use percentage-based margin -->

<div wire:intersect.margin.10%="loadMore">...</div>

 

<!-- Different margins for each side (top, right, bottom, left) -->

<div wire:intersect.margin.10%.25px.25px.25px="loadMore">...</div>


```


## [#](#fire-once "Permalink")Fire once

Use the `.once` modifier to ensure the action only fires on the first intersection:

```
<div wire:intersect.once="trackImpression">

    <!-- Action only fires once, even if scrolled past multiple times -->

</div>


```
This is particularly useful for analytics or tracking when you only want to record the first time a user sees something.

## [#](#combining-modifiers "Permalink")Combining modifiers

You can combine multiple modifiers to create precise behaviors:

```
<!-- Load when half visible, only once, with 100px margin -->

<div wire:intersect.once.half.margin.100px="loadSection">

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```

# 0040_wirepoll

# wire:poll

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Polling is a technique used in web applications to "poll" the server (send requests on a regular interval) for updates. It's a simple way to keep a page up-to-date without the need for a more sophisticated technology like [WebSockets](/docs/4.x/events#real-time-events-using-laravel-echo).

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Using polling inside Livewire is as simple as adding `wire:poll` to an element.

Below is an example of a `SubscriberCount` component that shows a user's subscriber count:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class SubscriberCount extends Component

{

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.subscriber-count', [

            'count' => Auth::user()->subscribers->count(),

        ]);

    }

}


```

```
<div wire:poll>

    Subscribers: {{ $count }}

</div>


```
Normally, this component would show the subscriber count for the user and never update until the page was refreshed. However, because of `wire:poll` on the component's template, this component will now refresh itself every `2.5` seconds, keeping the subscriber count up-to-date.

You can also specify an action to fire on the polling interval by passing a value to `wire:poll`:

```
<div wire:poll="refreshSubscribers">

    Subscribers: {{ $count }}

</div>


```
Now, the `refreshSubscribers()` method on the component will be called every `2.5` seconds.

## [#](#timing-control "Permalink")Timing control

The primary drawback of polling is that it can be resource intensive. If you have a thousand visitors on a page that uses polling, one thousand network requests will be triggered every `2.5` seconds.

The best way to reduce requests in this scenario is simply to make the polling interval longer.

You can manually control how often the component will poll by appending the desired duration to `wire:poll` like so:

```
<div wire:poll.15s> <!-- In seconds... -->

 

<div wire:poll.15000ms> <!-- In milliseconds... -->


```


## [#](#background-throttling "Permalink")Background throttling

To further cut down on server requests, Livewire automatically throttles polling when a page is in the background. For example, if a user keeps a page open in a different browser tab, Livewire will reduce the number of polling requests by 95% until the user revisits the tab.

If you want to opt-out of this behavior and keep polling continuously, even when a tab is in the background, you can add the `.keep-alive` modifier to `wire:poll`:

```
<div wire:poll.keep-alive>


```


## [#](#viewport-throttling "Permalink")Viewport throttling

Another measure you can take to only poll when necessary, is to add the `.visible` modifier to `wire:poll`. The `.visible` modifier instructs Livewire to only poll the component when it is visible on the page:

```
<div wire:poll.visible>


```
If a component using `wire:visible` is at the bottom of a long page, it won't start polling until the user scrolls it into the viewport. When the user scrolls away, it will stop polling again.

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
wire:poll

wire:poll="action"


```


### [#](#modifiers "Permalink")Modifiers

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.[number]s` | Poll interval in seconds (e.g., `.15s`) |
| `.[number]ms` | Poll interval in milliseconds (e.g., `.15000ms`) |
| `.keep-alive` | Continue polling even when the tab is in the background |
| `.visible` | Only poll when the element is visible in the viewport |




# 0041_wireoffline

# wire:offline

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

In real-time applications, it can be helpful to provide a visual indication that the user's device is no longer connected to the internet.

For example, if you have built a blogging platform on Livewire, you may want to notify your users if they are offline so that they don't draft an entire blog post without the ability for Livewire to save it to the database.

Livewire provides the `wire:offline` directive for such cases. By adding `wire:offline` to an element inside a Livewire component, it will be hidden by default and become visible when the user loses connection:

```
<div wire:offline>

    This device is currently offline.

</div>


```
The element will disappear again when the network connection is restored.

## [#](#toggling-classes "Permalink")Toggling classes

Adding the `class` modifier allows you to add a class to an element when the user loses their connection. The class will be removed again, once the user is back online:

```
<div wire:offline.class="bg-red-300">


```
Or, using the `.remove` modifier, you can remove a class when a user loses their connection. In this example, the `bg-green-300` class will be removed from the `<div>` while the user has lost their connection:

```
<div class="bg-green-300" wire:offline.class.remove="bg-green-300">


```


## [#](#toggling-attributes "Permalink")Toggling attributes

The `.attr` modifier allows you to add an attribute to an element when the user loses their connection. In this example, the "Save" button will be disabled while the user has lost their connection:

```
<button wire:offline.attr="disabled">Save</button>


```


## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
wire:offline


```


### [#](#modifiers "Permalink")Modifiers

| Modifier | Description |

# wire:ignore

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire's ability to make updates to the page is what makes it "live", however, there are times when you might want to prevent Livewire from updating a portion of the page.

In these cases, you can use the `wire:ignore` directive to instruct Livewire to ignore the contents of a particular element, even if they change between requests.

This is most useful in the context of working with third-party javascript libraries for custom form inputs and such.

Below is an example of wrapping an element used by a third-party library in `wire:ignore` so that Livewire doesn't tamper with the HTML generated by the library:

```
<form>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <div wire:ignore>

        <!-- This element would be reference by a -->

        <!-- third-party library for initialization... -->

        <input id="id-for-date-picker-library">

    </div>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```
You can also instruct Livewire to only ignore changes to attributes of the root element rather than observing changes to its contents using `wire:ignore.self`.

```
<div wire:ignore.self>

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```

# 0043_wireref

# wire:ref

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Refs in Livewire provide a way to name, then target an individual element or component inside Livewire.

They're useful for dispatching events or streaming content to a specific element.

They're a tidy alternative, but conceptually similar, to using something like classes/ids to target elements.

Here are a list of use-cases:

- Dispatching an event to a specific component
- Targeting an element using `$refs`
- Streaming content to a specific element


Let's walk through each of these.

## [#](#dispatching-events "Permalink")Dispatching events

Refs are a great way to target specific child components within Livewire's event system.

Consider the following Livewire modal component that listens for a *close* event:

```
<?php

 

new class extends Livewire\Component {

    public bool $isOpen = false;

 

    // ...

 

    #[On('close')]

    public function close()

    {

        $this->isOpen = false;

    }

};

?>

 

<div wire:show="isOpen">

    {{ $slot }}

</div>


```
By adding `wire:ref` to the component tag, you now dispatch the *close* event directly to it using the `ref:` parameter:

```
<?php

 

new class extends Livewire\Component {

    public function save()

    {

        //

 

        $this->dispatch('close')->to(ref: 'modal');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <livewire:modal wire:ref="modal">

        <!-- ... -->

 

        <button wire:click="save">Save</button>

    </livewire:modal>

</div>


```


## [#](#accessing-dom-elements "Permalink")Accessing DOM elements

When you add `wire:ref` to an HTML element, you can access it via the `$refs` magic property.

Consider a character counter that updates in real-time:

```
<div>

    <textarea wire:model="message" wire:ref="message"></textarea>

 

    Characters: <span wire:ref="count">0</span>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</div>

 

<script>

    this.$refs.message.addEventListener('input', (e) => {

        this.$refs.count.textContent = e.target.value.length

    })

</script>


```


## [#](#accessing-wire "Permalink")Accessing `$wire`

If you wish to access `$wire` for a component with a ref, you can do so via the `.$wire` propert on the element:

```
<div>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <livewire:modal wire:ref="modal">

        <!-- ... -->

 

        <button wire:click="save()">Save</button>

    </livewire:modal>

</div>

 

<script>

    this.$intercept('save', ({ onFinish }) => {

        onFinish(() => {

            this.$refs.modal.$wire.close()

        })

    })

</script>


```


## [#](#streaming-content "Permalink")Streaming content

Livewire supports streaming content directly to elements within a component using CSS selectors, however, `wire:ref` is a more convenient and discoverable approach.

Consider the following component that streams an answer directly from an LLM as it's generated:

```
<?php

 

new class extends Livewire\Component {

    public $question = '';

 

    public function ask()

    {

        Ai::ask($this->question, function ($chunk) {

            $this->stream($chunk)->to(ref: 'answer');

        });

 

        $this->reset('question');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="question">

 

    <button wire:click="ask"></button>

 

    <h2>Answer:</h2>

 

    <p wire:ref="answer"></p>

</div>


```


## [#](#dynamic-refs "Permalink")Dynamic refs

Refs work perfectly in loops and other dynamic contexts.

Here's an example with multiple modal instances:

```
@foreach($users as $index => $user)

    <livewire:modal

        wire:key="{{ $user->id }}"

        wire:ref="{{ 'user-modal-' . $user->id }}"

    >

        <!-- ... -->

    </livewire>

@endforeach


```


## [#](#scoping-behavior "Permalink")Scoping behavior

Refs are scoped to the current component. This means you can target any element within the component, but not elements in other components on the page.

If multiple elements have the same ref name within a component, the first one encountered will be used.

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
wire:ref="name"


```

# 0044_wirereplace

# wire:replace

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire's DOM diffing is useful for updating existing elements on your page, but occasionally you may need to force some elements to render from scratch to reset internal state.

In these cases, you can use the `wire:replace` directive to instruct Livewire to skip DOM diffing on the children of an element, and instead completely replace the content with the new elements from the server.

This is most useful in the context of working with third-party javascript libraries and custom web components, or when element re-use could cause problems when keeping state.

Below is an example of wrapping a web component with a shadow DOM `wire:replace` so that Livewire completely replaces the element allowing the custom element to handle its own life-cycle:

```
<form>

    <!-- ... -->

 

    <div wire:replace>

        <!-- This custom element would have its own internal state -->

        <json-viewer>@json($someProperty)</json-viewer>

    </div>

 

    <!-- ... -->

</form>


```
You can also instruct Livewire to replace the target element as well as all children with `wire:replace.self`.

```
<div x-data="{open: false}" wire:replace.self>

  <!-- Ensure that the "open" state is reset to false on each render -->

</div>


```

# 0045_wireshow

# wire:show

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire's `wire:show` directive makes it easy to show and hide elements based on the result of an expression.

The `wire:show` directive is different than using `@if` in Blade in that it toggles an element's visibility using CSS (`display: none`) rather than removing the element from the DOM entirely. This means the element remains in the page but is hidden, allowing for smoother transitions without requiring a server round-trip.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Here's a practical example of using `wire:show` to toggle a "Create Post" modal:

```
use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $showModal = false;

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create(['content' => $this->content]);

 

        $this->reset('content');

 

        $this->showModal = false;

    }

}


```

```
<div>

    <button x-on:click="$wire.showModal = true">New Post</button>

 

    <div wire:show="showModal">

        <form wire:submit="save">

            <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

 

            <button type="submit">Save Post</button>

        </form>

    </div>

</div>


```
When the "Create New Post" button is clicked, the modal appears without a server roundtrip. After successfully saving the post, the modal is hidden and the form is reset.

## [#](#using-transitions "Permalink")Using transitions

You can combine `wire:show` with Alpine.js transitions to create smooth show/hide animations. Since `wire:show` only toggles the CSS `display` property, Alpine's `x-transition` directives work perfectly with it:

```
<div>

    <button x-on:click="$wire.showModal = true">New Post</button>

 

    <div wire:show="showModal" x-transition.duration.500ms>

        <form wire:submit="save">

            <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

            <button type="submit">Save Post</button>

        </form>

    </div>

</div>


```
The Alpine.js transition classes above will create a fade and scale effect when the modal shows and hides.

Livewire provides drag-and-drop sorting through the `wire:sort` directive. Add it to a parent element and use `wire:sort:item` on each child to make lists sortable with smooth animations out of the box.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

To make a list sortable, add `wire:sort` to the parent element with a handler method name, and `wire:sort:item` to each child with a unique identifier:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public TodoList $list;

 

    public function handleSort($id, $position)

    {

        $task = $this->list->tasks()->findOrFail($id);

 

        // Update the task's position and re-order other tasks...

    }

};


```

```
<ul wire:sort="handleSort">

    @foreach ($list->tasks as $task)

        <li wire:key="{{ $task->id }}" wire:sort:item="{{ $task->id }}">

            {{ $task->title }}

        </li>

    @endforeach

</ul>


```
When a user drags and drops an item to a new position, Livewire will call your handler with two parameters: the item's identifier (from `wire:sort:item`) and the new zero-based position.

You are responsible for persisting the new order in your database.

## [#](#sorting-across-groups "Permalink")Sorting across groups

To allow dragging items between multiple lists, use `wire:sort:group` with the same group name on each container.

To identify which group the item was dropped into, add `wire:sort:group-id` to each container. Its value will be passed as a third parameter to your handler:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\Card;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Board $board;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function columns()

    {

        return $this->board->columns;

    }

 

    public function handleSort($id, $position, $columnId)

    {

        $card = $this->board->cards()->findOrFail($id);

 

        // Update the card's position and re-order other cards...

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    @foreach ($this->columns as $column)

        <ul wire:sort="handleSort" wire:sort:group="cards" wire:sort:group-id="{{ $column->id }}">

            @foreach ($column->cards as $card)

                <li wire:key="{{ $card->id }}" wire:sort:item="{{ $card->id }}">

                    {{ $card->title }}

                </li>

            @endforeach

        </ul>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
When an item is dragged to a different group, only the destination group's handler fires.

## [#](#sort-handles "Permalink")Sort handles

By default, users can drag an item by clicking anywhere on it. To restrict dragging to a specific handle, use `wire:sort:handle`:

```
<ul wire:sort="handleSort">

    @foreach ($list->tasks as $task)

        <li wire:key="{{ $task->id }}" wire:sort:item="{{ $task->id }}">

            <div wire:sort:handle>

                <!-- Drag icon... -->

            </div>

 

            {{ $task->title }}

        </li>

    @endforeach

</ul>


```
Now users can only initiate a drag from the handle element.

## [#](#ignoring-elements "Permalink")Ignoring elements

To prevent specific areas from triggering drag operations, use `wire:sort:ignore`. This is useful for buttons or other interactive elements inside sortable items:

```
<ul wire:sort="handleSort">

    @foreach ($list->tasks as $task)

        <li wire:key="{{ $task->id }}" wire:sort:item="{{ $task->id }}">

            {{ $task->title }}

 

            <div wire:sort:ignore>

                <button type="button">Edit</button>

            </div>

        </li>

    @endforeach

</ul>

# 0047_wirestream

# wire:stream

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Livewire allows you to stream content to a web page before a request is complete via the `wire:stream` API. This is an extremely useful feature for things like AI chat-bots which stream responses as they are generated.

Not compatible with Laravel Octane

Livewire currently does not support using `wire:stream` with Laravel Octane.

To demonstrate the most basic functionality of `wire:stream`, below is a simple CountDown component that when a button is pressed displays a count-down to the user from "3" to "0":

```
use Livewire\Component;

 

class CountDown extends Component

{

    public $start = 3;

 

    public function begin()

    {

        while ($this->start >= 0) {

            // Stream the current count to the browser...

            $this->stream(

                to: 'count',

                content: $this->start,

                replace: true,

            );

 

            // Pause for 1 second between numbers...

            sleep(1);

 

            // Decrement the counter...

            $this->start = $this->start - 1;

        };

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            <button wire:click="begin">Start count-down</button>

 

            <h1>Count: <span wire:stream="count">{{ $start }}</span></h1>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

}


```
Here's what's happening from the user's perspective when they press "Start count-down":

- "Count: 3" is shown on the page
- They press the "Start count-down" button
- One second elapses and "Count: 2" is shown
- This process continues until "Count: 0" is shown


All of the above happens while a single network request is out to the server.

Here's what's happening from the system's perspective when the button is pressed:

- A request is sent to Livewire to call the `begin()` method
- The `begin()` method is called and the `while` loop begins
- `$this->stream()` is called and immediately starts a "streamed response" to the browser
- The browser receives a streamed response with instructions to find the element in the component with `wire:stream="count"`, and replace its contents with the received payload ("3" in the case of the first streamed number)
- The `sleep(1)` method causes the server to hang for one second
- The `while` loop is repeated and the process of streaming a new number every second continues until the `while` condition is falsy
- When `begin()` has finished running and all the counts have been streamed to the browser, Livewire finishes it's request lifecycle, rendering the component and sending the final response to the browser


## [#](#streaming-chat-bot-responses "Permalink")Streaming chat-bot responses

A common use-case for `wire:stream` is streaming chat-bot responses as they are received from an API that supports streamed responses (like [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)).

Below is an example of using `wire:stream` to accomplish a ChatGPT-like interface:

```
use Livewire\Component;

 

class ChatBot extends Component

{

    public $prompt = '';

 

    public $question = '';

 

    public $answer = '';

 

    function submitPrompt()

    {

        $this->question = $this->prompt;

 

        $this->prompt = '';

 

        $this->js('$wire.ask()');

    }

 

    function ask()

    {

        $this->answer = OpenAI::ask($this->question, function ($partial) {

            $this->stream(to: 'answer', content: $partial);

        });

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            <section>

                <div>ChatBot</div>

 

                @if ($question)

                    <article>

                        <hgroup>

                            <h3>User</h3>

                            <p>{{ $question }}</p>

                        </hgroup>

 

                        <hgroup>

                            <h3>ChatBot</h3>

                            <p wire:stream="answer">{{ $answer }}</p>

                        </hgroup>

                    </article>

                @endif

            </section>

 

            <form wire:submit="submitPrompt">

                <input wire:model="prompt" type="text" placeholder="Send a message" autofocus>

            </form>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

}


```
Here's what's going on in the above example:

- A user types into a text field labeled "Send a message" to ask the chat-bot a question.
- They press the [Enter] key.
- A network request is sent to the server, sets the message to the `$question` property, and clears the `$prompt` property.
- The response is sent back to the browser and the input is cleared. Because `$this->js('...')` was called, a new request is triggered to the server calling the `ask()` method.
- The `ask()` method calls on the ChatBot API and receives streamed response partials via the `$partial` parameter in the callback.
- Each `$partial` gets streamed to the browser into the `wire:stream="answer"` element on the page, showing the answer progressively reveal itself to the user.
- When the entire response is received, the Livewire request finishes and the user receives the full response.


## [#](#replace-vs-append "Permalink")Replace vs. append

When streaming content to an element using `$this->stream()`, you can tell Livewire to either replace the contents of the target element with the streamed contents or append them to the existing contents.

Replacing or appending can both be desirable depending on the scenario. For example, when streaming a response from a chatbot, typically appending is desired (and is therefore the default). However, when showing something like a count-down, replacing is more fitting.

You can configure either by passing the `replace:` parameter to `$this->stream` with a boolean value:

```
// Append contents...

$this->stream(to: 'target', content: '...');

 

// Replace contents...

$this->stream(to: 'target', content: '...', replace: true);


```
Append/replace can also be specified at the target element level by appending or removing the `.replace` modifier:

```
// Append contents...

<div wire:stream="target">

 

// Replace contents...

<div wire:stream.replace="target">


```

# 0048_wiretext

# wire:text

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

`wire:text` is a directive that dynamically updates an element's text content based on a component property or expression. Unlike using Blade's `{{ }}` syntax, `wire:text` updates the content without requiring a network roundtrip to re-render the component.

If you are familiar with Alpine's `x-text` directive, the two are essentially the same.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Here's an example of using `wire:text` to optimistically show updates to a Livewire property without waiting for a network roundtrip.

```
use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public Post $post;

 

    public $likes;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->likes = $this->post->like_count;

    }

 

    public function like()

    {

        $this->post->like();

 

        $this->likes = $this->post->fresh()->like_count;

    }

}


```

```
<div>

    <button x-on:click="$wire.likes++" wire:click="like">❤️ Like</button>

 

    Likes: <span wire:text="likes"></span>

</div>


```
When the button is clicked, `$wire.likes++` immediately updates the displayed count through `wire:text`, while `wire:click="like"` persists the change to the database in the background.

This pattern makes `wire:text` perfect for building optimistic UIs in Livewire.

# 0049_Async

# Async

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Async]` attribute allows actions to run in parallel without being queued, making them execute immediately even if other requests are in-flight.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Async]` attribute to any action method that should run in parallel:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Async]

    public function logActivity()

    {

        Activity::log('post-viewed', $this->post);

    }

};


```

```
<div wire:intersect="logActivity">

    <!-- Logs activity asynchronously when element enters viewport -->

</div>


```
When `logActivity()` is called, it executes immediately without blocking other requests or being blocked by them.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Async]` for fire-and-forget operations where the result doesn't affect what's displayed on the page:

- **Analytics and logging** - Tracking user behavior, page views, or interactions
- **Background operations** - Triggering jobs, sending notifications, or updating external services
- **JavaScript-only results** - Fetching data via `await $wire.getData()` that will be consumed purely by JavaScript


Here's an example tracking external link clicks:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡external-link.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $url;

 

    #[Async]

    public function trackClick()

    {

        Analytics::track('external-link-clicked', [

            'url' => $this->url,

            'user_id' => auth()->id(),

        ]);

    }

};


```

```
<a href="{{ $url }}" target="_blank" wire:click="trackClick">

    Visit External Site

</a>


```
Because tracking happens asynchronously, the user's click isn't delayed by the network request.

## [#](#when-not-to-use "Permalink")When NOT to use

Async actions and state mutations don't mix

**Never use async actions if they modify component state that's reflected in your UI.** Because async actions run in parallel, you can end up with unpredictable race conditions where your component's state diverges across multiple simultaneous requests.

Consider this dangerous example:

```
// Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do...

 

<?php // resources/views/components/⚡counter.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 0;

 

    #[Async] // Don't do this!

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++; // State mutation in an async action

    }

};


```
If a user rapidly clicks the increment button, multiple async requests fire simultaneously. Each request starts with the same initial `$count` value, leading to lost updates. You might click 5 times but only see the counter increment by 1.

**The rule of thumb:** Only use async for actions that perform pure side effects—operations that don't change any properties that affect your component's view.

## [#](#alternative-approach "Permalink")Alternative approach

### [#](#using-the-async-modifier "Permalink")Using the .async modifier

Instead of using the attribute, you can make specific action calls async with the `.async` modifier:

```
<button wire:click.async="logActivity">Track Event</button>


```
This approach is useful when you want the action to be async in some places but synchronous in others.

# 0050_Computed

# Computed

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Computed]` attribute allows you to create derived properties that are cached during a request, providing a performance advantage when accessing expensive operations multiple times.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Computed]` attribute to any method to turn it into a cached property:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $userId;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function user()

    {

        return User::find($this->userId);

    }

 

    public function follow()

    {

        Auth::user()->follow($this->user);

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $this->user->name }}</h1>

    <span>{{ $this->user->email }}</span>

 

    <button wire:click="follow">Follow</button>

</div>


```
The `user()` method is accessed like a property using `$this->user`. The first time it's called, the result is cached and reused for the rest of the request.

Must use`$this` in templates

Unlike normal properties, computed properties must be accessed via `$this` in your template. For example, `$this->posts` instead of `$posts`.

## [#](#performance-advantage "Permalink")Performance advantage

Computed properties cache their result for the duration of a request. If you access `$this->posts` multiple times, the underlying method only executes once:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts; // Only queries database once

    }

};


```
This allows you to freely access derived values without worrying about performance implications.

## [#](#busting-the-cache "Permalink")Busting the cache

If the underlying data changes during a request, you can clear the cache using `unset()`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Auth::user()->posts;

    }

 

    public function createPost()

    {

        if ($this->posts->count() > 10) {

            throw new \Exception('Maximum post count exceeded');

        }

 

        Auth::user()->posts()->create(...);

 

        unset($this->posts); // Clear cache

    }

};


```
After creating a new post, `unset($this->posts)` clears the cache so the next access retrieves the updated data.

## [#](#caching-between-requests "Permalink")Caching between requests

By default, computed properties only cache within a single request. To cache across multiple requests, use the `persist` parameter:

```
#[Computed(persist: true)]

public function user()

{

    return User::find($this->userId);

}


```
This caches the value for 3600 seconds (1 hour). You can customize the duration:

```
#[Computed(persist: true, seconds: 7200)] // 2 hours


```


## [#](#caching-across-all-components "Permalink")Caching across all components

To share cached values across all component instances in your application, use the `cache` parameter:

```
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use App\Models\Post;

 

#[Computed(cache: true)]

public function posts()

{

    return Post::all();

}


```
You can optionally set a custom cache key:

```
#[Computed(cache: true, key: 'homepage-posts')]


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Computed properties are especially useful when:

- **Conditionally accessing expensive data** - Only query the database if the value is actually used in the template
- **Using inline templates** - No opportunity to pass data via `render()`
- **Omitting the render method** - Following v4's single-file component convention
- **Accessing the same value multiple times** - Automatic caching prevents redundant queries


## [#](#limitations "Permalink")Limitations

Not supported on Form objects

Computed properties cannot be used on `Livewire\Form` objects. Attempting to access them via `$form->property` will result in an error.

## [#](#learn-more "Permalink")Learn more

For detailed information about computed properties, caching strategies, and advanced use cases, see the [Computed Properties documentation](/docs/4.x/computed-properties).

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
#[Computed(

    bool $persist = false,

    int $seconds = 3600,

    bool $cache = false,

    ?string $key = null,

)]


```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$persist` | `bool` | `false` | Cache the value across requests for the same component instance |
| `$seconds` | `int` | `3600` | Duration in seconds to cache the value |

# 0051_Defer

# Defer

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Defer]` attribute makes a component load immediately after the initial page load is complete, preventing slow components from blocking the page render.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Defer]` attribute to any component that should be deferred:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new #[Defer] class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
With `#[Defer]`, the component initially renders as an empty `<div></div>`, then loads immediately after the page finishes loading—without waiting for it to enter the viewport.

## [#](#lazy-vs-defer "Permalink")Lazy vs Defer

Livewire provides two ways to delay component loading:

- **Lazy loading (`#[Lazy]`)** - Components load when they become visible in the viewport (when the user scrolls to them)
- **Deferred loading (`#[Defer]`)** - Components load immediately after the initial page load is complete


Both prevent slow components from blocking your initial page render, but differ in when the component actually loads.

## [#](#rendering-placeholders "Permalink")Rendering placeholders

By default, Livewire renders an empty `<div></div>` before the component loads. You can provide a custom placeholder using the `placeholder()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new #[Defer] class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

 

    public function placeholder()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            <svg><!-- Loading spinner... --></svg>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
Users will see the loading spinner until the component fully loads.

Match placeholder element type

If your placeholder's root element is a `<div>`, your component must also use a `<div>` element.

## [#](#bundling-requests "Permalink")Bundling requests

By default, deferred components load in parallel with independent network requests. To bundle multiple deferred components into a single request, use the `bundle` parameter:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Defer;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Defer(bundle: true)] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
Now, if there are ten `revenue` components on the page, all ten will load via a single bundled network request instead of ten parallel requests.

## [#](#alternative-approach "Permalink")Alternative approach

### [#](#using-the-defer-parameter "Permalink")Using the defer parameter

Instead of the attribute, you can defer specific component instances using the `defer` parameter:

```
<livewire:revenue defer />


```
This is useful when you only want certain instances of a component to be deferred.

### [#](#overriding-the-attribute "Permalink")Overriding the attribute

If a component has `#[Defer]` but you want to load it immediately in certain cases, you can override it:

```
<livewire:revenue :defer="false" />


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Defer]` when:

- Components contain slow operations (database queries, API calls) that would delay page load
- The component is always visible on initial page load (if it's below the fold, use `#[Lazy]` instead)
- You want to improve perceived performance by showing the page faster

The `#[Isolate]` attribute prevents a component's requests from being bundled with other component updates, allowing it to execute in parallel.

## [#](#why-bundling-matters "Permalink")Why bundling matters

Every component update in Livewire triggers a network request. By default, when multiple components trigger updates at the same time, they are bundled into a single request.

This results in fewer network connections to the server and can drastically reduce server load. In addition to the performance gains, this also unlocks features internally that require collaboration between multiple components ([Reactive Properties](/docs/4.x/nesting#reactive-props), [Modelable Properties](/docs/4.x/nesting#binding-to-child-data-using-wiremodel), etc.)

However, there are times when disabling this bundling is desired for performance reasons. That's where `#[Isolate]` comes in.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Isolate]` attribute to any component that should send isolated requests:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Isolate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new #[Isolate] class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function refreshStats()

    {

        // Expensive operation...

        $this->post->recalculateStatistics();

    }

};


```
With `#[Isolate]`, this component's requests will no longer be bundled with other component updates, allowing them to execute in parallel.

When bundling helps vs hurts

Bundling is great for most scenarios, but if a component performs expensive operations, bundling can slow down the entire request. Isolating that component allows it to run in parallel with other updates.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Isolate]` when:

- The component performs expensive operations (complex queries, API calls, heavy computations)
- Multiple components use `wire:poll` and you want independent polling intervals
- Components listen for events and you don't want one slow component to block others
- The component doesn't need to coordinate with other components on the page


## [#](#example-polling-components "Permalink")Example: Polling components

Here's a practical example with multiple polling components:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡system-status.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Isolate;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Isolate] class extends Component {

    public function checkStatus()

    {

        // Expensive external API call...

        return ExternalService::getStatus();

    }

};


```

```
<div wire:poll.5s>

    Status: {{ $this->checkStatus() }}

</div>


```
Without `#[Isolate]`, this component's slow API call would delay other components on the page. With it, the component polls independently without blocking others.

## [#](#lazy-components-are-isolated-by-default "Permalink")Lazy components are isolated by default

When using the `#[Lazy]` attribute, components are automatically isolated to load in parallel. You can disable this behavior if needed:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Lazy(isolate: false)] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
Now multiple `revenue` components will bundle their lazy-load requests into a single network request.

## [#](#trade-offs "Permalink")Trade-offs

**Benefits:**

- Prevents slow components from blocking other updates
- Allows true parallel execution of expensive operations
- Independent polling and event handling


**Drawbacks:**

- More network requests to the server
- Can't coordinate with other components in the same request
- Slightly higher server overhead from multiple connections




# 0053_Js

# Js

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Js]` attribute designates methods that return JavaScript code to be executed on the client-side. Methods marked with `#[Js]` can be called directly from your templates without making a server request.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Js]` attribute to methods that return JavaScript expressions:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Js;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

    public $content = '';

 

    #[Js]

    public function resetForm()

    {

        return <<<'JS'

            $wire.title = ''

            $wire.content = ''

        JS;

    }

};


```

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <input wire:model="title" placeholder="Title">

    <textarea wire:model="content" placeholder="Content"></textarea>

 

    <button type="submit">Save</button>

    <button type="button" @click="$wire.resetForm()">Reset</button>

</form>


```
When `$wire.resetForm()` is called, the JavaScript executes directly in the browser — no server round-trip occurs.

## [#](#executing-javascript-after-server-actions "Permalink")Executing JavaScript after server actions

If you need to execute JavaScript **after a server action completes**, use the `js()` method instead:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        Post::create(['title' => $this->title]);

 

        $this->js("alert('Post saved successfully!')");

    }

};


```
The `js()` method queues JavaScript to be executed when the server response arrives.

## [#](#accessing-wire "Permalink")Accessing $wire

You can access the component's `$wire` object inside JavaScript expressions:

```
#[Js]

public function resetForm()

{

    return <<<'JS'

        $wire.title = ''

        $wire.content = ''

    JS;

}


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Js]` when you need to:

- Reset or clear form fields without server overhead
- Trigger JavaScript animations or transitions
- Update client-side state without re-rendering
- Execute reusable JavaScript logic from multiple places
- Integrate with third-party JavaScript libraries


## [#](#javascript-actions-vs-js-methods "Permalink")JavaScript actions vs #[Js] methods

There's an important distinction:

- **`#[Js]` methods** are defined in PHP and return JavaScript code. They are called via `$wire.methodName()` without making a server request.
- **JavaScript actions** (`$js.methodName`) are defined entirely in JavaScript using `@script` blocks.


Both approaches execute JavaScript on the client without a server round-trip. The difference is where the JavaScript code is defined.

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡example.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Js;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 0;

 

    // JavaScript defined in PHP

    #[Js]

    public function showCount()

    {

        return "alert('Count is: {$this->count}')";

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <button @click="$wire.showCount()">Show Count (from PHP)</button>

    <button @click="$js.incrementLocal()">Increment Local (from JS)</button>

</div>

 

@script

<script>

    // JavaScript defined in JavaScript

    $js('incrementLocal', () => {

        console.log('No server request made')

    })

</script>

@endscript


```

# 0054_Json

# Json

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Json]` attribute marks an action as a JSON endpoint, returning data directly to JavaScript. Validation errors trigger a promise rejection with structured error data. This is ideal for actions consumed by JavaScript rather than rendered in Blade.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Json]` attribute to any action method that returns data for JavaScript consumption:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡search.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Json;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Json]

    public function search($query)

    {

        return Post::where('title', 'like', "%{$query}%")

            ->limit(10)

            ->get();

    }

};


```

```
<div x-data="{ query: '', posts: [] }">

    <input

        type="text"

        x-model="query"

        x-on:input.debounce="$wire.search(query).then(data => posts = data)"

    >

 

    <ul>

        <template x-for="post in posts">

            <li x-text="post.title"></li>

        </template>

    </ul>

</div>


```
The `search()` method returns posts directly to Alpine, where they're stored in the `posts` array and rendered client-side.

## [#](#handling-responses "Permalink")Handling responses

JSON methods resolve with the return value on success, and reject on validation failure:

**On success:**

```
let data = await $wire.search('query')

// data = [ { id: 1, title: '...' }, ...]


```
**On validation failure:**

```
try {

    let data = await $wire.save()

} catch (e) {

    // e.status = 422

    // e.errors = { name: ['The name field is required.'] }

}


```
Or using `.catch()`:

```
$wire.save()

    .then(data => {

        // Handle success

        console.log(data)

    })

    .catch(e => {

        if (e.status === 422) {

            // Handle validation errors

            console.log(e.errors)

        }

    })


```


## [#](#error-rejection-shape "Permalink")Error rejection shape

When a promise is rejected, the error object has this structure:

```
{

    status: 422,    // HTTP status code (422 for validation errors)

    body: null,     // Raw response body (null for validation errors)

    json: null,     // Parsed JSON (null for validation errors)

    errors: {...}   // Validation errors object

}


```
For HTTP errors (500, etc.), the shape is the same but with the actual response data:

```
{

    status: 500,

    body: '<html>...</html>',

    json: null,

    errors: null

}


```


## [#](#behavior "Permalink")Behavior

The `#[Json]` attribute automatically applies two behaviors:

1. **Skips rendering** - The component doesn't re-render after the action completes, since the response is consumed by JavaScript
2. **Runs asynchronously** - The action executes in parallel without blocking other requests


These behaviors match what you'd expect from an API-style endpoint.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Json]` when:

- **Building dynamic search/autocomplete** - Fetching results for a dropdown or suggestion list
- **Loading data into JavaScript** - Populating charts, maps, or other JS-driven UI
- **Submitting forms with JS handling** - When you want to handle success/error states in JavaScript
- **Integrating with third-party libraries** - Providing data to libraries that manage their own rendering


Validation errors are isolated

Validation errors from JSON methods are only returned via promise rejection. They don't appear in `$wire.$errors` or the component's error bag. This is intentional—JSON methods are self-contained and don't affect the component's rendered state.

# 0055_Layout

# Layout

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Layout]` attribute specifies which Blade layout a full-page component should use, allowing you to customize layouts on a per-component basis.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Layout]` attribute to a full-page component to use a specific layout:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Layout;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new #[Layout('layouts::dashboard')] class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::all();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <h1>Posts</h1>

    @foreach ($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">{{ $post->title }}</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
This component will render using the `resources/views/layouts/dashboard.blade.php` layout instead of the default.

## [#](#default-layout "Permalink")Default layout

By default, Livewire uses the layout specified in your `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'component_layout' => 'layouts::app',


```
The `#[Layout]` attribute overrides this default for specific components.

## [#](#passing-data-to-layouts "Permalink")Passing data to layouts

You can pass additional data to your layout using array syntax:

```
new #[Layout('layouts::dashboard', ['title' => 'Posts Dashboard'])] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
In your layout file, the `$title` variable will be available:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>{{ $title ?? 'My App' }}</title>

</head>

<body>

    {{ $slot }}

</body>

</html>


```


## [#](#alternative-using-layout-method "Permalink")Alternative: Using layout() method

Instead of the attribute, you can use the `layout()` method in your `render()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.posts.index')

            ->layout('layouts::dashboard', ['title' => 'Posts']);

    }

};


```
The attribute approach is cleaner for single-file components that don't need a `render()` method.

## [#](#using-different-layouts-per-page "Permalink")Using different layouts per page

A common pattern is to use different layouts for different sections of your app:

```
// Admin pages

new #[Layout('layouts::admin')] class extends Component { }

 

// Marketing pages

new #[Layout('layouts::marketing')] class extends Component { }

 

// Dashboard pages

new #[Layout('layouts::dashboard')] class extends Component { }


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Layout]` when:

- You have multiple layouts in your application (admin, marketing, dashboard, etc.)
- A specific page needs a different layout than the default
- You're building a full-page component (not a regular component)
- You want to keep layout configuration close to the component definition


Only for full-page components

The `#[Layout]` attribute only applies to full-page components. Regular components that are rendered within other views don't use layouts.

## [#](#learn-more "Permalink")Learn more

For more information about full-page components and layouts, see the [Pages documentation](/docs/4.x/pages#layouts).

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
#[Layout(

    string $name,

```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

| `$params` | `array` | `[]` | Additional data to pass to the layout |




# 0056_Lazy

# Lazy

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Lazy]` attribute makes a component load only when it becomes visible in the viewport, preventing slow components from blocking the initial page render.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Lazy]` attribute to any component that should be lazy-loaded:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new #[Lazy] class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
With `#[Lazy]`, the component initially renders as an empty `<div></div>`, then loads when it enters the viewport—typically when a user scrolls to it.

## [#](#lazy-vs-defer "Permalink")Lazy vs Defer

Livewire provides two ways to delay component loading:

- **Lazy loading (`#[Lazy]`)** - Components load when they become visible in the viewport (when the user scrolls to them)
- **Deferred loading (`#[Defer]`)** - Components load immediately after the initial page load is complete


Use lazy loading for components below the fold that users might not scroll to. Use defer for components that are always visible but you want to load after the page renders.

## [#](#rendering-placeholders "Permalink")Rendering placeholders

By default, Livewire renders an empty `<div></div>` before the component loads. You can provide a custom placeholder using the `placeholder()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new #[Lazy] class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

 

    public function placeholder()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            <div class="animate-pulse bg-gray-200 h-20 rounded"></div>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
Users will see a skeleton placeholder until the component enters the viewport and loads.

Match placeholder element type

If your placeholder's root element is a `<div>`, your component must also use a `<div>` element.

## [#](#bundling-requests "Permalink")Bundling requests

By default, lazy components load in parallel with independent network requests. To bundle multiple lazy components into a single request, use the `bundle` parameter:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Lazy;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Lazy(bundle: true)] class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
Now, if there are ten `revenue` components on the page, all ten will load via a single bundled network request instead of ten parallel requests.

## [#](#alternative-approach "Permalink")Alternative approach

### [#](#using-the-lazy-parameter "Permalink")Using the lazy parameter

Instead of the attribute, you can lazy-load specific component instances using the `lazy` parameter:

```
<livewire:revenue lazy />


```
This is useful when you only want certain instances of a component to be lazy-loaded.

### [#](#overriding-the-attribute "Permalink")Overriding the attribute

If a component has `#[Lazy]` but you want to load it immediately in certain cases, you can override it:

```
<livewire:revenue :lazy="false" />


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Lazy]` when:

- Components contain slow operations (database queries, API calls) that would delay page load
- The component is below the fold and users might not scroll to it
- You want to improve perceived performance by showing the page faster
- You have multiple expensive components on a single page

# 0057_Locked

# Locked

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Locked]` attribute prevents properties from being modified on the client-side, protecting sensitive data like model IDs from tampering by users.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Locked]` attribute to any public property that should not be changed from the frontend:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Locked;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Locked]

    public $postId;

 

    public function mount($id)

    {

        $this->postId = $id;

    }

 

    public function delete()

    {

        Post::find($this->postId)->delete();

 

        return redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```
If a user attempts to modify a locked property through browser DevTools or by tampering with requests, Livewire will throw an exception and prevent the action from executing.

Backend modifications still allowed

Properties with the `#[Locked]` attribute can still be changed in your component's PHP code. The lock only prevents client-side tampering. Be careful not to pass untrusted user input to locked properties in your own methods.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Locked]` when you need to:

- Store model IDs that should never be changed by users
- Preserve authorization-sensitive data throughout component lifecycle
- Protect any public property that acts as a security boundary


Model properties are secure by default

If you store an Eloquent model in a public property, Livewire automatically ensures the ID isn't tampered with—no `#[Locked]` attribute needed:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post; // Already protected

 

    public function mount($id)

    {

        $this->post = Post::find($id);

    }

};


```

## [#](#why-not-protected-properties "Permalink")Why not protected properties?

You might wonder why you can't just use `protected` properties for sensitive data.

Remember, Livewire only persists public properties between requests. Protected properties work fine for static, hard-coded values, but any data that needs to be stored at runtime must use a public property to persist properly between requests.

This is where `#[Locked]` becomes essential: it gives you the persistence of public properties with protection against client-side tampering.

## [#](#cant-livewire-do-this-automatically "Permalink")Can't Livewire do this automatically?

In a perfect world, Livewire would lock properties by default and only allow modifications when `wire:model` is used on that property.

Unfortunately, that would require Livewire to parse all of your Blade templates to understand if a property is modified by `wire:model` or a similar API.

Not only would that add technical and performance overhead, it would be impossible to detect if a property is mutated by something like Alpine or any other custom JavaScript.

Therefore, Livewire will continue to make public properties freely mutable by default and give developers the tools to lock them as needed.




# 0058_Modelable

# Modelable

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Modelable]` attribute designates a property in a child component that can be bound to from a parent component using `wire:model`.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Modelable]` attribute to a property in a child component to make it bindable:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-input.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Modelable]

    public $value = '';

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="value">

</div>


```
Now the parent component can bind to this child component just like any other input element:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todo = '';

 

    public function addTodo()

    {

        // Use $this->todo here...

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <livewire:todo-input wire:model="todo" />

 

    <button wire:click="addTodo">Add Todo</button>

</div>


```
When the user types in the `todo-input` component, the parent's `$todo` property automatically updates.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

Without `#[Modelable]`, you would need to manually handle two-way communication between parent and child:

```
// Without #[Modelable] - manual approach

<livewire:todo-input

    :value="$todo"

    @input="todo = $event.value"

/>


```
The `#[Modelable]` attribute simplifies this by allowing `wire:model` to work directly on the component.

## [#](#building-reusable-input-components "Permalink")Building reusable input components

`#[Modelable]` is perfect for creating custom input components that feel like native HTML inputs:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡date-picker.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Modelable]

    public $date = '';

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input

        type="date"

        wire:model="date"

        class="border rounded px-3 py-2"

    >

</div>


```

```
{{-- Usage in parent --}}

<livewire:date-picker wire:model="startDate" />

<livewire:date-picker wire:model="endDate" />


```


Your component's root element cannot be a form control with `wire:model`. Wrap your input in a wrapper element like `<div>`. Livewire injects `wire:model` and `x-modelable` on the root element to wire up the parent binding — a second `wire:model` on the same element creates a conflict.

## [#](#modifiers "Permalink")Modifiers

The parent can use `wire:model` modifiers for timing and network control:

```
{{-- Live updates on every keystroke --}}

<livewire:todo-input wire:model.live="todo" />

 

{{-- Debounce updates --}}

<livewire:todo-input wire:model.live.debounce.500ms="todo" />

 

{{-- Throttle updates --}}

<livewire:todo-input wire:model.live.throttle.500ms="todo" />


```


Caleb’s Note

Event-based modifiers like `.blur`, `.change`, and `.enter` control DOM events on specific elements, not reactive component bindings. To control sync timing for modelable components, place these modifiers on the actual input element inside the child component:

```
<livewire:todo-input wire:model="todo" />

 

<input wire:model.blur="value" />


```

## [#](#example-custom-rich-text-editor "Permalink")Example: Custom rich text editor

Here's a more complex example of a rich-text editor component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡rich-editor.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Modelable]

    public $content = '';

};

?>

 

<div>

    <div

        x-init="

            // Initialize your rich text editor library here

            editor.on('change', () => {

                $wire.content = editor.getContent()

            })

        "

    >

        <!-- Rich text editor UI -->

    </div>

</div>


```

```
{{-- Usage --}}

<livewire:rich-editor wire:model="postContent" />


```


## [#](#limitations "Permalink")Limitations

Only one modelable property per component

Currently Livewire only supports a single `#[Modelable]` attribute per component, so only the first one will be bound.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Modelable]` when:

- Creating reusable input components (date pickers, color pickers, rich text editors)
- Building form components that need to work with `wire:model`
- Wrapping third-party JavaScript libraries as Livewire components
- Creating custom inputs with special validation or formatting

# 0059_On

# On

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[On]` attribute allows a component to listen for events and execute a method when those events are dispatched.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[On]` attribute to any method that should be called when an event is dispatched:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[On('post-created')]

    public function updatePostList($title)

    {

        session()->flash('status', "New post created: {$title}");

    }

};


```
When another component dispatches the `post-created` event, the `updatePostList()` method will be called automatically.

## [#](#dispatching-events "Permalink")Dispatching events

To dispatch an event that triggers listeners, use the `dispatch()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $post = Post::create(['title' => $this->title]);

 

        $this->dispatch('post-created', title: $post->title);

 

        return redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```
The `post-created` event will trigger any methods decorated with `#[On('post-created')]`.

## [#](#passing-data-to-listeners "Permalink")Passing data to listeners

Events can pass data as named parameters:

```
// Dispatching with multiple parameters

$this->dispatch('post-updated', id: $post->id, title: $post->title);


```

```
// Listening and receiving parameters

#[On('post-updated')]

public function handlePostUpdate($id, $title)

{

    // Use $id and $title...

}


```


## [#](#dynamic-event-names "Permalink")Dynamic event names

You can use component properties in event names for scoped listening:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[On('post-updated.{post.id}')]

    public function refreshPost()

    {

        $this->post->refresh();

    }

};


```
If `$post->id` is `3`, this will only listen for `post-updated.3` events, ignoring updates to other posts.

## [#](#multiple-event-listeners "Permalink")Multiple event listeners

A single method can listen for multiple events:

```
#[On('post-created')]

#[On('post-updated')]

#[On('post-deleted')]

public function refreshStats()

{

    // Refresh statistics when any post changes

}


```


## [#](#listening-to-browser-events "Permalink")Listening to browser events

You can also listen for browser events dispatched from JavaScript:

```
#[On('user-logged-in')]

public function handleUserLogin()

{

    // Handle login...

}


```

```
// From JavaScript

window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('user-logged-in'));


```


## [#](#alternative-listening-in-the-template "Permalink")Alternative: Listening in the template

Instead of using the attribute, you can listen for events directly on child components in your Blade template:

```
<livewire:post.edit @saved="$refresh" />


```
This listens for the `saved` event from the `post.edit` child component and refreshes the parent when it's dispatched.

You can also call specific methods:

```
<livewire:post.edit @saved="handleSave($event.id)" />


```


## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[On]` when:

- One component needs to react to actions in another component
- Implementing real-time notifications or updates
- Building loosely coupled components that communicate via events
- Listening for browser or Laravel Echo events
- Refreshing data when external changes occur


## [#](#example-real-time-notifications "Permalink")Example: Real-time notifications

Here's a practical example of a notification bell that listens for new notifications:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡notification-bell.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\On;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $unreadCount = 0;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->unreadCount = auth()->user()->unreadNotifications()->count();

    }

 

    #[On('notification-sent')]

    public function incrementCount()

    {

        $this->unreadCount++;

    }

 

    #[On('notifications-read')]

    public function resetCount()

    {

        $this->unreadCount = 0;

    }

};

?>

 

<button class="relative">

    <svg><!-- Bell icon --></svg>

    @if($unreadCount > 0)

        <span class="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-xs">

            {{ $unreadCount }}

        </span>

    @endif

</button>


```
Other components can dispatch events to update the notification count:

```
// From anywhere in your app

$this->dispatch('notification-sent');


```

# 0060_Reactive

# Reactive

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Reactive]` attribute makes a child component's property automatically update when the parent changes the value being passed in.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Reactive]` attribute to any property that should react to parent changes:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Reactive;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Reactive]

    public $todos;

 

    #[Computed]

    public function count()

    {

        return $this->todos->count();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    Count: {{ $this->count }}

</div>


```
Now when the parent component adds or removes todos, the child component will automatically update to reflect the new count.

## [#](#why-props-arent-reactive-by-default "Permalink")Why props aren't reactive by default

By default, Livewire props are **not reactive**. When a parent component updates, only the parent's state is sent to the server—not the child's. This minimizes data transfer and improves performance.

Here's what happens without `#[Reactive]`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos = [];

 

    public function addTodo($text)

    {

        $this->todos[] = ['text' => $text];

        // Child components with $todos props won't automatically update

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <livewire:todo-count :$todos />

 

    <button wire:click="addTodo('New task')">Add Todo</button>

</div>


```
Without `#[Reactive]` on the child's `$todos` property, adding a todo in the parent won't update the child's count.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

When you add `#[Reactive]`:

1. Parent updates its `$todos` property
2. Parent sends new `$todos` value to the child during the response
3. Child component automatically re-renders with the new value


This creates a "reactive" relationship similar to frontend frameworks like Vue or React.

## [#](#performance-considerations "Permalink")Performance considerations

Use reactive properties sparingly

Reactive properties require additional data to be sent between server and client on every parent update. Only use `#[Reactive]` when necessary for your use case.

**When to use:**

- Child component displays data that changes in the parent
- Child needs to stay in sync with parent state
- You're building a tightly coupled parent-child relationship


**When NOT to use:**

- Initial data is passed once and never changes
- Child manages its own independent state
- Performance is critical and updates aren't needed


## [#](#example-live-search-results "Permalink")Example: Live search results

Here's a practical example of a search component with reactive results:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡search.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $query = '';

 

    public function posts()

    {

        return Post::where('title', 'like', "%{$this->query}%")->get();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="query" placeholder="Search posts...">

 

    <livewire:search-results :posts="$this->posts()" />

</div>


```

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡search-results.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Reactive;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Reactive]

    public $posts;

};

?>

 

<div>

    @foreach($posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">{{ $post->title }}</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
As the user types, the parent's `$posts` changes and the child's results automatically update.

## [#](#alternative-events "Permalink")Alternative: Events

For loosely coupled components, consider using events instead of reactive props:

```
// Parent dispatches event

$this->dispatch('todos-updated', todos: $this->todos);

 

// Child listens for event

#[On('todos-updated')]

public function handleTodosUpdate($todos)

{

    $this->todos = $todos;

}


```
Events provide more flexibility but require explicit communication between components.

# 0061_Renderless

# Renderless

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Renderless]` attribute skips the rendering phase of Livewire's lifecycle when an action is called, improving performance for actions that don't modify the component's view.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Renderless]` attribute to any action method that doesn't need to re-render the component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Renderless;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

    }

 

    #[Renderless]

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>

 

    <div wire:intersect="incrementViewCount"></div>

</div>


```
The example above uses `wire:intersect` to call `incrementViewCount()` when the user scrolls to the bottom. Since `#[Renderless]` is applied, the view count is logged but the template doesn't re-render—no part of the page is affected.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Renderless]` when an action:

- Only performs backend operations (logging, analytics, tracking)
- Doesn't modify any properties that affect the rendered view
- Needs to run frequently without causing unnecessary re-renders


Common use cases include:

- Tracking user interactions (clicks, scrolls, time on page)
- Sending analytics events
- Updating counters or metrics
- Performing background operations


## [#](#alternative-approaches "Permalink")Alternative approaches

### [#](#using-skiprender "Permalink")Using skipRender()

If you need to conditionally skip rendering or prefer not to use attributes, you can call `skipRender()` directly in your action:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

 

        $this->skipRender();

    }

};


```


### [#](#using-the-renderless-modifier "Permalink")Using the .renderless modifier

You can also skip rendering directly from the element using the `.renderless` modifier:

```
<button type="button" wire:click.renderless="incrementViewCount">

    Track View

</button>


```
This approach is useful for one-off cases where you don't want to add an attribute to the method.

# 0062_Session

# Session

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Session]` attribute persists a property's value in the user's session, maintaining it across page refreshes and navigation.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Session]` attribute to any property that should persist in the session:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Session;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Session]

    public $search = '';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function posts()

    {

        return $this->search === ''

            ? Post::all()

            : Post::where('title', 'like', "%{$this->search}%")->get();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="search" placeholder="Search posts...">

 

    @foreach($this->posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">{{ $post->title }}</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
After a user enters a search value, they can refresh the page or navigate away and return—the search value will be preserved.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

Every time the property changes, Livewire stores its new value in the user's session. When the component loads, Livewire fetches the value from the session and initializes the property with it.

This creates a persistent user experience without modifying the URL.

## [#](#session-vs-url "Permalink")Session vs URL

Both `#[Session]` and `#[Url]` persist property values, but with different trade-offs:

| Feature | `#[Session]` | `#[Url]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Persists across refreshes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persists when sharing URL | ❌ | ✅ |
| Keeps URL clean | ✅ | ❌ |
| Visible to user | ❌ | ✅ |
| Shareable state | ❌ | ✅ |


Use `#[Session]` when you want persistence without cluttering the URL or when state shouldn't be shareable.

## [#](#custom-session-keys "Permalink")Custom session keys

By default, Livewire generates session keys using the component and property names. You can customize this:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Session;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Session(key: 'post_search')]

    public $search = '';

};


```
The property will be stored in the session using the key `post_search`.

## [#](#dynamic-session-keys "Permalink")Dynamic session keys

You can generate keys dynamically using other properties:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Session;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Author;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Author $author;

 

    #[Session(key: 'search-{author.id}')]

    public $search = '';

};


```
If `$author->id` is `4`, the session key becomes `search-4`. This allows different session values per author.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Session]` when:

- Persisting user preferences (theme, language, sidebar state)
- Maintaining filter/search state across page navigation
- Storing form data to prevent loss on refresh
- Keeping UI state private to the user
- Avoiding URL clutter from query parameters


## [#](#example-dashboard-filters "Permalink")Example: Dashboard filters

Here's a practical example of persisting dashboard filters:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Session;

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Session]

    public $dateRange = '30days';

 

    #[Session]

    public $category = 'all';

 

    #[Session]

    public $sortBy = 'date';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function transactions()

    {

        return Transaction::query()

            ->when($this->dateRange === '30days', fn($q) => $q->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subDays(30)))

            ->when($this->category !== 'all', fn($q) => $q->where('category', $this->category))

            ->orderBy($this->sortBy)

            ->get();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <select wire:model.live="dateRange">

        <option value="7days">Last 7 days</option>

        <option value="30days">Last 30 days</option>

        <option value="year">This year</option>

    </select>

 

    <select wire:model.live="category">

        <option value="all">All categories</option>

        <option value="income">Income</option>

        <option value="expense">Expense</option>

    </select>

 

    <select wire:model.live="sortBy">

        <option value="date">Date</option>

        <option value="amount">Amount</option>

    </select>

 

    @foreach($this->transactions as $transaction)

        <div wire:key="{{ $transaction->id }}">{{ $transaction->description }}</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Users can set their preferred filters and they'll persist across sessions, page refreshes, and navigation.

## [#](#performance-considerations "Permalink")Performance considerations

Don't store large amounts of data

Laravel sessions are loaded into memory during every request. Storing too much in a user's session can slow down your entire application for that user. Avoid storing large collections or objects.

**Good uses:**

- Simple values (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Small arrays (filter options, preferences)
- Model IDs (not entire models)


**Bad uses:**

- Large collections
- Complete Eloquent models
- Binary data or file contents


Alternative: URL persistence

If you want state to be shareable via URL or bookmarkable, consider using the [`#[Url]` attribute](/docs/4.x/url) instead of `#[Session]`. URL parameters persist state in the address bar while session properties keep the URL clean.

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
#[Session(

    ?string $key = null,

)]


```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

# 0063_Title

# Title

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Title]` attribute sets the page title for full-page Livewire components.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Title]` attribute to a full-page component to set its title:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Title;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Title('Create Post')] class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        // Save post...

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <h1>Create a New Post</h1>

 

    <input type="text" wire:model="title" placeholder="Post title">

    <textarea wire:model="content" placeholder="Post content"></textarea>

 

    <button wire:click="save">Save Post</button>

</div>


```
The browser tab will display "Create Post" as the page title.

## [#](#layout-configuration "Permalink")Layout configuration

For the `#[Title]` attribute to work, your layout file must include a `$title` variable:

```
<!-- resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php -->

 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>{{ $title ?? 'My App' }}</title>

</head>

<body>

    {{ $slot }}

</body>

</html>


```
The `?? 'My App'` provides a fallback title if none is specified.

## [#](#dynamic-titles "Permalink")Dynamic titles

For dynamic titles using component properties, use the `title()` method in the `render()` method:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount($id)

    {

        $this->post = Post::findOrFail($id);

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return $this->view()

            ->title("Edit: {$this->post->title}");

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <h1>Edit Post</h1>

    <!-- ... -->

</div>


```
The title will dynamically include the post's title.

## [#](#combining-with-layouts "Permalink")Combining with layouts

You can use both `#[Title]` and `#[Layout]` together:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Layout;

use Livewire\Attributes\Title;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new

#[Layout('layouts.admin')]

#[Title('Create Post')]

class extends Component {

    // ...

};


```
This component will use the admin layout with "Create Post" as the title.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Title]` when:

- Building full-page components
- You want clean, declarative title definitions
- The title is static or rarely changes
- You're following SEO best practices


Use `title()` method when:

- The title depends on component properties
- You need to compute the title dynamically
- The title changes based on component state


## [#](#example-crud-pages "Permalink")Example: CRUD pages

Here's a complete example showing titles across CRUD operations:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Title;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Title('All Posts')] class extends Component { };


```

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Title;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new #[Title('Create Post')] class extends Component { };


```

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡edit.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function render()

    {

        return $this->view()->title("Edit: {$this->post->title}");

    }

};


```

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/posts/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function render()

    {

        return $this->view()->title($this->post->title);

    }

};


```
Each page has a contextually appropriate title that improves user experience and SEO.

## [#](#seo-considerations "Permalink")SEO considerations

Good page titles are crucial for SEO:

- **Be descriptive** - "Edit Post: Getting Started with Laravel" is better than "Edit"
- **Keep it concise** - Aim for 50-60 characters to avoid truncation in search results
- **Include keywords** - Help search engines understand your page content
- **Be unique** - Each page should have a distinct title


## [#](#only-for-full-page-components "Permalink")Only for full-page components

Full-page components only

The `#[Title]` attribute only works for full-page components accessed via routes. Regular components rendered within other views don't use titles—they inherit the parent page's title.

The `#[Transition]` attribute configures view transition behavior for action methods, allowing you to set transition types or skip transitions entirely.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Transition]` attribute to action methods that should trigger specific transition animations:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class Wizard extends Component

{

    public $step = 1;

 

    #[Transition(type: 'forward')]

    public function next()

    {

        $this->step++;

    }

 

    #[Transition(type: 'backward')]

    public function previous()

    {

        $this->step--;

    }

}


```

```
<div>

    <div wire:transition="content">

        Step {{ $step }}

    </div>

 

    <button wire:click="previous">Back</button>

    <button wire:click="next">Next</button>

</div>


```
The transition type can be targeted in CSS using the `:active-view-transition-type()` selector:

```
html:active-view-transition-type(forward) {

    &::view-transition-old(content) {

        animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-left;

    }

    &::view-transition-new(content) {

        animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-right;

    }

}

 

html:active-view-transition-type(backward) {

    &::view-transition-old(content) {

        animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-right;

    }

    &::view-transition-new(content) {

        animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-left;

    }

}

 

@keyframes slide-out-left {

    from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }

    to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }

}

 

@keyframes slide-in-right {

    from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }

    to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }

}

 

@keyframes slide-out-right {

    from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }

    to { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }

}

 

@keyframes slide-in-left {

    from { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }

    to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }

}


```


## [#](#skipping-transitions "Permalink")Skipping transitions

Use `skip: true` to disable transitions for specific actions:

```
#[Transition(skip: true)]

public function reset()

{

    $this->step = 1;

}


```
This is useful for actions like "reset" or "cancel" that should instantly update without animation.

## [#](#parameters "Permalink")Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | The transition type name (e.g., `'forward'`, `'backward'`) |
| `skip` | `bool` | Set to `true` to disable transitions for this action |


## [#](#alternative-approaches "Permalink")Alternative approaches

### [#](#using-transition "Permalink")Using transition()

For dynamic transition types that depend on runtime logic, use the `transition()` method instead:

```
public function goToStep($step)

{

    $this->transition(type: $step > $this->step ? 'forward' : 'backward');

 

    $this->step = $step;

}


```


### [#](#using-skiptransition "Permalink")Using skipTransition()

You can also skip transitions imperatively:

```
public function reset()

{

    $this->skipTransition();

 

    $this->step = 1;

}


```

# 0065_Url

# Url

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Url]` attribute stores a property's value in the URL's query string, allowing users to share and bookmark specific states of a page.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Url]` attribute to any property that should persist in the URL:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\User;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url]

    public $search = '';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function users()

    {

        return User::search($this->search)->get();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="search" placeholder="Search users...">

 

    <ul>

        @foreach ($this->users as $user)

            <li wire:key="{{ $user->id }}">{{ $user->name }}</li>

        @endforeach

    </ul>

</div>


```
When a user types "bob" into the search field, the URL updates to `https://example.com/users?search=bob`. If they share this URL or refresh the page, the search value persists.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

The `#[Url]` attribute does two things:

1. **Writes to URL** - When the property changes, it updates the query string
2. **Reads from URL** - On page load, it initializes the property from the query string


This creates a shareable, bookmarkable state for your component.

## [#](#url-vs-session "Permalink")URL vs Session

Both `#[Url]` and `#[Session]` persist property values, but with different trade-offs:

| Feature | `#[Url]` | `#[Session]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Persists across refreshes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persists when sharing URL | ✅ | ❌ |
| Keeps URL clean | ❌ | ✅ |
| Visible to user | ✅ | ❌ |
| Shareable state | ✅ | ❌ |


Use `#[Url]` when you want users to be able to share or bookmark the current state. Use `#[Session]` when state should be private.

## [#](#using-an-alias "Permalink")Using an alias

Shorten or obfuscate property names in the URL with the `as` parameter:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url(as: 'q')]

    public $search = '';

};


```
The URL will show `?q=bob` instead of `?search=bob`.

## [#](#excluding-values "Permalink")Excluding values

By default, Livewire only adds query parameters when values differ from their initial value. Use `except` to customize this:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url(except: '')]

    public $search = '';

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->search = auth()->user()->username;

    }

};


```
Now Livewire will only exclude `search` from the URL when it's an empty string, not when it equals the initial username value.

## [#](#always-show-in-url "Permalink")Always show in URL

To always include the parameter in the URL, even when empty, use `keep`:

```
#[Url(keep: true)]

public $search = '';


```
The URL will always show `?search=` even when the value is empty.

## [#](#nullable-properties "Permalink")Nullable properties

Use nullable type hints to treat empty query parameters as `null` instead of empty strings:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/user/⚡index.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url]

    public ?string $search;

};


```
Now `?search=` sets `$search` to `null` instead of `''`.

## [#](#browser-history "Permalink")Browser history

By default, Livewire uses `history.replaceState()` to modify the URL without adding browser history entries. To add history entries (making the back button restore previous query values), use `history`:

```
#[Url(history: true)]

public $search = '';


```
Now clicking the browser's back button will restore previous search values instead of navigating to the previous page.

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Url]` when:

- Building search or filter interfaces
- Implementing pagination
- Creating shareable views (map positions, selected filters, etc.)
- Allowing users to bookmark specific states
- Supporting browser back/forward navigation through states


## [#](#example-product-filtering "Permalink")Example: Product filtering

Here's a practical example of filtering products with multiple URL parameters:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/⚡products.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Product;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Url(as: 'q')]

    public $search = '';

 

    #[Url]

    public $category = 'all';

 

    #[Url]

    public $minPrice = 0;

 

    #[Url]

    public $maxPrice = 1000;

 

    #[Url]

    public $sort = 'name';

 

    #[Computed]

    public function products()

    {

        return Product::query()

            ->when($this->search, fn($q) => $q->search($this->search))

            ->when($this->category !== 'all', fn($q) => $q->where('category', $this->category))

            ->whereBetween('price', [$this->minPrice, $this->maxPrice])

            ->orderBy($this->sort)

            ->paginate(20);

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model.live="search" placeholder="Search products...">

 

    <select wire:model.live="category">

        <option value="all">All Categories</option>

        <option value="electronics">Electronics</option>

        <option value="clothing">Clothing</option>

    </select>

 

    <input type="range" wire:model.live="minPrice" min="0" max="1000">

    <input type="range" wire:model.live="maxPrice" min="0" max="1000">

 

    <select wire:model.live="sort">

        <option value="name">Name</option>

        <option value="price">Price</option>

        <option value="created_at">Newest</option>

    </select>

 

    @foreach($this->products as $product)

        <div wire:key="{{ $product->id }}">{{ $product->name }} - ${{ $product->price }}</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```
Users can share URLs like:

```
https://example.com/products?q=laptop&category=electronics&minPrice=500&maxPrice=1500&sort=price


```


## [#](#seo-considerations "Permalink")SEO considerations

Query parameters are indexed by search engines and included in analytics:

- **Good for SEO** - Each unique query combination creates a unique URL that can be indexed
- **Analytics tracking** - Track which filters and searches users are using
- **Shareable on social media** - Query parameters are preserved when sharing links


## [#](#learn-more "Permalink")Learn more

For more information about URL query parameters, including the `queryString()` method and trait hooks, see the [URL Query Parameters documentation](/docs/4.x/url).

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
#[Url(

    ?string $as = null,

    bool $history = false,

    bool $keep = false,

)]


```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$as` | `?string` | `null` | Custom name for the query parameter in the URL |
| `$history` | `bool` | `false` | Push URL changes to browser history (enables back button) |
| `$keep` | `bool` | `false` | Keep the query parameter when navigating away |
| `$except` | `mixed` | `null` | Value(s) to exclude from the URL |
| `$nullable` | `mixed` | `null` | Value to use when query parameter is missing from URL |




# 0066_Validate

# Validate

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `#[Validate]` attribute associates validation rules with component properties, enabling automatic real-time validation and clean rule declaration.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Apply the `#[Validate]` attribute to properties that need validation:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3')]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $this->validate();

 

        Post::create([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

 

        return redirect('/posts');

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="text" wire:model="title">

    @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <textarea wire:model="content"></textarea>

    @error('content') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <button wire:click="save">Save Post</button>

</div>


```
With `#[Validate]`, Livewire automatically validates properties on each update, providing instant feedback to users.

## [#](#how-it-works "Permalink")How it works

When you add `#[Validate]` to a property:

1. **Automatic validation** - Property is validated every time it's updated
2. **Real-time feedback** - Users see validation errors immediately
3. **Manual validation** - You still call `$this->validate()` before saving to ensure all properties are validated


## [#](#real-time-validation "Permalink")Real-time validation

By default, `#[Validate]` validates properties as they're updated:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡registration.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate('required|email|unique:users,email')]

    public $email = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:8')]

    public $password = '';

};

?>

 

<div>

    <input type="email" wire:model.live.blur="email">

    @error('email') <span>{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

 

    <input type="password" wire:model.live.blur="password">

    @error('password') <span>{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

</div>


```
As users fill out the form, they receive immediate validation feedback.

## [#](#disabling-auto-validation "Permalink")Disabling auto-validation

To validate only when explicitly calling `$this->validate()`, use `onUpdate: false`:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate('required|min:3', onUpdate: false)]

    public $title = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:3', onUpdate: false)]

    public $content = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        $validated = $this->validate();

        Post::create($validated);

        return redirect('/posts');

    }

};


```
Now validation only runs when `save()` is called, not on every property update.

## [#](#custom-attribute-names "Permalink")Custom attribute names

Customize the field name in validation messages:

```
#[Validate('required', as: 'date of birth')]

public $dob;


```
Error message will be "The date of birth field is required" instead of "The dob field is required".

## [#](#custom-validation-messages "Permalink")Custom validation messages

Override default validation messages:

```
#[Validate('required', message: 'Please provide a post title')]

public $title;


```
For multiple rules, use multiple attributes:

```
#[Validate('required', message: 'Please provide a post title')]

#[Validate('min:3', message: 'This title is too short')]

public $title;


```


## [#](#array-validation "Permalink")Array validation

Validate array properties and their children:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡task-list.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate([

        'tasks' => 'required|array|min:1',

        'tasks.*' => 'required|string|min:3',

    ])]

    public $tasks = [];

 

    public function addTask()

    {

        $this->tasks[] = '';

    }

};


```
This validates both the array itself and each individual task.

## [#](#limitations "Permalink")Limitations

Rule objects not supported

PHP attributes can't use Laravel's Rule objects directly. For complex rules like `Rule::exists()`, use a `rules()` method instead:

```
protected function rules()

{

    return [

        'email' => ['required', 'email', Rule::unique('users')->ignore($this->userId)],

    ];

}


```

## [#](#when-to-use "Permalink")When to use

Use `#[Validate]` when:

- Building forms with real-time validation feedback
- Co-locating validation rules with property definitions
- Creating simple, readable validation logic
- Implementing inline validation for better UX


Use `rules()` method when:

- You need Laravel's Rule objects
- Rules depend on dynamic values
- You're working with complex conditional validation
- You prefer centralized rule definition


## [#](#example-contact-form "Permalink")Example: Contact form

Here's a complete contact form with validation:

```
<?php // resources/views/pages/⚡contact.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Mail\ContactMessage;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Validate('required|min:2', as: 'name')]

    public $name = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|email')]

    public $email = '';

 

    #[Validate('required')]

    public $subject = '';

 

    #[Validate('required|min:10', as: 'message')]

    public $message = '';

 

    public function submit()

    {

        $validated = $this->validate();

 

        Mail::to('[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)')->send(new ContactMessage($validated));

 

        session()->flash('success', 'Message sent successfully!');

 

        $this->reset();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @if (session('success'))

        <div class="alert">{{ session('success') }}</div>

    @endif

 

    <form wire:submit="submit">

        <div>

            <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="name" placeholder="Your name">

            @error('name') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

        </div>

 

        <div>

            <input type="email" wire:model.live.blur="email" placeholder="Your email">

            @error('email') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

        </div>

 

        <div>

            <input type="text" wire:model.live.blur="subject" placeholder="Subject">

            @error('subject') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

        </div>

 

        <div>

            <textarea wire:model.live.blur="message" placeholder="Your message"></textarea>

            @error('message') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

        </div>

 

        <button type="submit">Send Message</button>

    </form>

</div>


```
Users get immediate feedback as they fill out the form, with friendly field names and helpful error messages.

# 0067_@island

# @island

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `@island` directive creates isolated regions within a component that update independently, without re-rendering the entire component.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Wrap any portion of your template with `@island` to create an isolated region:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Revenue;

 

new class extends Component {

    #[Computed]

    public function revenue()

    {

        // Expensive calculation...

        return Revenue::yearToDate();

    }

};

?>

 

<div>

    @island

        <div>

            Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

            <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

        </div>

    @endisland

 

    <div>

        <!-- Other content... -->

    </div>

</div>


```
When the "Refresh" button is clicked, only the island re-renders—the rest of the component remains untouched.

## [#](#lazy-loading-islands "Permalink")Lazy loading islands

Defer an island's initial render until after the page loads using the `lazy` parameter:

```
@island(lazy: true)

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    </div>

@endisland


```
The island displays a loading state initially, then fetches its content in a separate request.

### [#](#lazy-vs-deferred "Permalink")Lazy vs Deferred

By default, `lazy` waits until the island is visible in the viewport. Use `defer` to load immediately after page load:

```
{{-- Loads when scrolled into view --}}

@island(lazy: true)

    <!-- ... -->

@endisland

 

{{-- Loads immediately after page load --}}

@island(defer: true)

    <!-- ... -->

@endisland


```


## [#](#custom-loading-states "Permalink")Custom loading states

Use `@placeholder` to customize what displays while loading:

```
@island(lazy: true)

    @placeholder

        <div class="animate-pulse">

            <div class="h-32 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>

        </div>

    @endplaceholder

 

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

    </div>

@endisland


```


## [#](#named-islands "Permalink")Named islands

Give islands names to target them from elsewhere in your component:

```
@island(name: 'revenue')

    <div>Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}</div>

@endisland

 

<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue">

    Refresh revenue

</button>


```
The `wire:island` directive scopes updates to specific islands.

## [#](#why-use-islands "Permalink")Why use islands?

Islands provide performance isolation without the overhead of creating separate child components, managing props, or dealing with component communication.

**Use islands when:**

- You want to isolate expensive computations
- You need independent update regions within one component
- You want simpler architecture than nested components


[Learn more about islands →](/docs/4.x/islands)

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

```
@island(

    ?string $name = null,

    bool $lazy = false,

    bool $defer = false,

)

    <!-- Content -->

@endisland


```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$name` | `?string` | `null` | A unique name for targeting the island with `wire:island` |
| `$lazy` | `bool` | `false` | Defer rendering until the island is visible in the viewport |
| `$defer` | `bool` | `false` | Load immediately after page load instead of waiting for viewport visibility |




# 0068_@placeholder

# @placeholder

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `@placeholder` directive displays custom content while lazy or deferred components and islands are loading.

## [#](#basic-usage-with-lazy-components "Permalink")Basic usage with lazy components

For single-file and multi-file components, use `@placeholder` to specify what displays during loading:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡revenue.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Transaction;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $amount;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        // Slow database query...

        $this->amount = Transaction::monthToDate()->sum('amount');

    }

};

?>

 

@placeholder

    <div>

        <!-- Loading spinner -->

        <svg class="animate-spin h-5 w-5">...</svg>

    </div>

@endplaceholder

 

<div>

    Revenue this month: {{ $amount }}

</div>


```
When rendered with `<livewire:revenue lazy />`, the placeholder displays until the component loads.

View-based components only

The `@placeholder` directive works for single-file and multi-file components. For class-based components, use the `placeholder()` method instead.

Matching root element types

The placeholder and component must share the same root element type. If your placeholder uses `<div>`, your component must also use `<div>`.

## [#](#usage-with-islands "Permalink")Usage with islands

Use `@placeholder` inside lazy islands to customize loading states:

```
@island(lazy: true)

    @placeholder

        <div class="animate-pulse">

            <div class="h-32 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>

        </div>

    @endplaceholder

 

    <div>

        Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}

 

        <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh</button>

    </div>

@endisland


```
The placeholder appears while the island is loading, then gets replaced with the actual content.

## [#](#skeleton-placeholders "Permalink")Skeleton placeholders

Placeholders are ideal for skeleton loaders that match your content's layout:

```
@placeholder

    <div class="space-y-4">

        <div class="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4"></div>

        <div class="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>

        <div class="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-5/6"></div>

    </div>

@endplaceholder

 

<div>

    <!-- Actual content -->

    <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>

    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>

</div>


```

# 0069_@persist

# @persist

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `@persist` directive preserves elements across page navigations when using `wire:navigate`, maintaining their state and avoiding re-initialization.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Wrap an element with `@persist` and provide a unique name to preserve it across page visits:

```
@persist('player')

    <audio src="{{ $episode->file }}" controls></audio>

@endpersist


```
When navigating to a new page that also contains a persisted element with the same name, Livewire reuses the existing DOM element instead of creating a new one. For an audio player, this means playback continues uninterrupted.

Requires wire:navigate

The `@persist` directive only works when navigation is handled by Livewire's `wire:navigate` feature. Standard page loads will not preserve elements.

## [#](#common-use-cases "Permalink")Common use cases

**Audio/video players**

```
@persist('podcast-player')

    <audio src="{{ $episode->audio_url }}" controls></audio>

@endpersist


```
**Chat widgets**

```
@persist('support-chat')

    <div id="chat-widget">

        <!-- Chat interface... -->

    </div>

@endpersist


```
**Third-party widgets**

```
@persist('analytics-widget')

    <div id="analytics-dashboard">

        <!-- Complex widget that's expensive to initialize... -->

    </div>

@endpersist


```


## [#](#placement-in-layouts "Permalink")Placement in layouts

Persisted elements should typically be placed outside Livewire components, commonly in your main layout:

```
<!-- resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php -->

 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <title>{{ $title ?? config('app.name') }}</title>

 

        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])

 

        @livewireStyles

    </head>

    <body>

        <main>

            {{ $slot }}

# 0070_@teleport

# @teleport

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

The `@teleport` directive renders a portion of your template in a different location in the DOM, outside the component's normal placement.

## [#](#basic-usage "Permalink")Basic usage

Wrap content with `@teleport` and specify where to render it using a CSS selector:

```
<div>

    <div x-data="{ open: false }">

        <button @click="open = ! open">Toggle Modal</button>

 

        @teleport('body')

            <div x-show="open">

                Modal contents...

            </div>

        @endteleport

    </div>

</div>


```
The modal content will be rendered at the end of the `<body>` element:

```
<body>

    <!-- Page content... -->

 

    <div x-show="open">

        Modal contents...

    </div>

</body>


```


Any valid CSS selector

The `@teleport` selector can be any string you would pass to `document.querySelector()`, such as `'body'`, `'#modal-root'`, or `'.modal-container'`.

## [#](#why-use-teleport "Permalink")Why use teleport?

Teleporting is useful for nested modals, dropdowns, and popovers where parent styles or z-index values can interfere with proper rendering.

**Without teleporting:**

```
<div style="z-index: 10;">

    <!-- Parent modal with z-index: 10 -->

 

    <div style="z-index: 20;">

        <!-- Child modal inherits parent's stacking context -->

        <!-- Backdrop may not cover parent modal properly -->

    </div>

</div>


```
**With teleporting:**

```
<div style="z-index: 10;">

    <!-- Parent modal -->

 

    @teleport('body')

        <div style="z-index: 20;">

            <!-- Child modal rendered as sibling at body level -->

            <!-- Backdrop can cover everything properly -->

        </div>

    @endteleport

</div>


```


## [#](#common-use-cases "Permalink")Common use cases

**Valid:**

```
@teleport('body')

    <div>

        <h2>Title</h2>

# 0071_Morphing

# Morphing

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

When a Livewire component updates the browser's DOM, it does so in an intelligent way we call "morphing". The term *morph* is in contrast with a word like *replace*.

Instead of *replacing* a component's HTML with newly rendered HTML every time a component is updated, Livewire dynamically compares the current HTML with the new HTML, identifies differences, and makes surgical changes to the HTML only in the places where changes are needed.

This has the benefit of preserving existing, un-changed elements on a component. For example, event listeners, focus state, and form input values are all preserved between Livewire updates. Of course, morphing also offers increased performance compared to wiping and re-rending new DOM on every update.

## [#](#how-morphing-works "Permalink")How morphing works

To understand how Livewire determines which elements to update between Livewire requests, consider this simple `Todos` component:

```
class Todos extends Component

{

    public $todo = '';

 

    public $todos = [

        'first',

        'second',

    ];

 

    public function add()

    {

        $this->todos[] = $this->todo;

    }

}


```

```
<form wire:submit="add">

    <ul>

        @foreach ($todos as $item)

            <li wire:key="{{ $loop->index }}">{{ $item }}</li>

        @endforeach

    </ul>

 

    <input wire:model="todo">

</form>


```
The initial render of this component will output the following HTML:

```
<form wire:submit="add">

    <ul>

        <li>first</li>

 

        <li>second</li>

    </ul>

 

    <input wire:model="todo">

</form>


```
Now, imagine you typed "third" into the input field and pressed the `[Enter]` key. The newly rendered HTML would be:

```
 <form wire:submit="add">

     <ul>

         <li>first</li>

  

         <li>second</li>

  

+        <li>third</li>

     </ul>

  

     <input wire:model="todo">

 </form>


```
When Livewire processes the component update, it *morphs* the original DOM into the newly rendered HTML. The following visualization should intuitively give you an understanding of how it works:

[https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600772?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479](https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600772?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479)

As you can see, Livewire walks both HTML trees simultaneously. As it encounters each element in both trees, it compares them for changes, additions, and removals. If it detects one, it surgically makes the appropriate change.

## [#](#morphing-shortcomings "Permalink")Morphing shortcomings

The following are scenarios where morphing algorithms fail to correctly identify the change in HTML trees and therefore cause problems in your application.

### [#](#inserting-intermediate-elements "Permalink")Inserting intermediate elements

Consider the following Livewire Blade template for a fictitious `CreatePost` component:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <div>

        <input wire:model="title">

    </div>

 

    @if ($errors->has('title'))

        <div>{{ $errors->first('title') }}</div>

    @endif

 

    <div>

        <button>Save</button>

    </div>

</form>


```
If a user tries submitting the form, but encounters a validation error, the following problem occurs:

[https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600840?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479](https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600840?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479)

As you can see, when Livewire encounters the new `<div>` for the error message, it doesn't know whether to change the existing `<div>` in-place, or insert the new `<div>` in the middle.

To re-iterate what's happening more explicitly:

- Livewire encounters the first `<div>` in both trees. They are the same, so it continues.
- Livewire encounters the second `<div>` in both trees and thinks they are the same `<div>`, just one has changed contents. So instead of inserting the error message as a new element, it changes the `<button>` into an error message.
- Livewire then, after mistakenly modifying the previous element, notices an additional element at the end of the comparison. It then creates and appends the element after the previous one.
- Therefore, destroying, then re-creating an element that otherwise should have been simply moved.


This scenario is at the root of almost all morph-related bugs.

Here are a few specific problematic impacts of these bugs:

- Event listeners and element state are lost between updates
- Event listeners and state are misplaced across the wrong elements
- Entire Livewire components can be reset or duplicated as Livewire components are also simply elements in the DOM tree
- Alpine components and state can be lost or misplaced


Fortunately, Livewire has worked hard to mitigate these problems using the following approaches:

### [#](#internal-look-ahead "Permalink")Internal look-ahead

Livewire has an additional step in its morphing algorithm that checks subsequent elements and their contents before changing an element.

This prevents the above scenario from happening in many cases.

Here is a visualization of the "look-ahead" algorithm in action:

[https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600800?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479](https://player.vimeo.com/video/844600800?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479)

### [#](#injecting-morph-markers "Permalink")Injecting morph markers

On the backend, Livewire automatically detects conditionals inside Blade templates and wraps them in HTML comment markers that Livewire's JavaScript can use as a guide when morphing.

Here's an example of the previous Blade template but with Livewire's injected markers:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <div>

        <input wire:model="title">

    </div>

 

    <!--[if BLOCK]><![endif]-->

    @if ($errors->has('title'))

        <div>Error: {{ $errors->first('title') }}</div>

    @endif

    <!--[if ENDBLOCK]><![endif]-->

 

    <div>

        <button>Save</button>

    </div>

</form>


```
With these markers injected into the template, Livewire can now more easily detect the difference between a change and an addition.

This feature is extremely beneficial to Livewire applications, but because it requires parsing templates via regex, it can sometimes fail to properly detect conditionals. If this feature is more of a hindrance than a help to your application, you can disable it with the following configuration in your application's `config/livewire.php` file:

```
'inject_morph_markers' => false,


```


#### [#](#wrapping-conditionals "Permalink")Wrapping conditionals

If the above two solutions don't cover your situation, the most reliable way to avoid morphing problems is to wrap conditionals and loops in their own elements that are always present.

For example, here's the above Blade template rewritten with wrapping `<div>` elements:

```
<form wire:submit="save">

    <div>

        <input wire:model="title">

    </div>

 

    <div>

        @if ($errors->has('title'))

            <div>{{ $errors->first('title') }}</div>

        @endif

    </div>

 

    <div>

        <button>Save</button>

    </div>

</form>


```
Now that the conditional has been wrapped in a persistent element, Livewire will morph the two different HTML trees properly.

#### [#](#bypassing-morphing "Permalink")Bypassing morphing

If you need to bypass morphing entirely for an element, you can use [wire:replace](/docs/4.x/wire-replace) to instruct livewire to replace all children of an element instead of attempting to morph the existing elements.

# Hydration

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Using Livewire feels like attaching a server-side PHP class directly to a web browser. Things like calling server-side functions directly from button presses support this illusion. But in reality, it is just that: an illusion.

In the background, Livewire actually behaves much more like a standard web application. It renders static HTML to the browser, listens for browser events, then makes AJAX requests to invoke server-side code.

Because each AJAX request Livewire makes to the server is "stateless" (meaning there isn't a long running backend process keeping the state of a component alive), Livewire must re-create the last-known state of a component before making any updates.

It does this by taking "snapshots" of the PHP component after each server-side update so that the component can be re-created or *resumed* on the next request.

Throughout this documentation, we will refer to the process of taking the snapshot as "dehydration" and the process of re-creating a component from a snapshot as "hydration".

## [#](#dehydrating "Permalink")Dehydrating

When Livewire *dehydrates* a server-side component, it does two things:

- Renders the component's template to HTML
- Creates a JSON snapshot of the component


### [#](#rendering-html "Permalink")Rendering HTML

After a component is mounted or an update has been made, Livewire calls a component's `render()` method to convert the Blade template to raw HTML.

Take the following `counter` component for example:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 1;

 

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++;

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return <<<'HTML'

        <div>

            Count: {{ $count }}

 

            <button wire:click="increment">+</button>

        </div>

        HTML;

    }

};


```
After each mount or update, Livewire would render the above `counter` component to the following HTML:

```
<div>

    Count: 1

 

    <button wire:click="increment">+</button>

</div>


```


### [#](#the-snapshot "Permalink")The snapshot

In order to re-create the `counter` component on the server during the next request, a JSON snapshot is created, attempting to capture as much of the state of the component as possible:

```
{

    state: {

        count: 1,

    },

 

    memo: {

        name: 'counter',

 

        id: '1526456',

    },

}


```
Notice two different portions of the snapshot: `memo`, and `state`.

The `memo` portion is used to store the information needed to identify and re-create the component, while the `state` portion stores the values of all the component's public properties.

The above snapshot is a condensed version of an actual snapshot in Livewire. In live applications, the snapshot contains much more information, such as validation errors, a list of child components, locales, and much more. For a more detailed look at a snapshot object you may reference the [snapshot schema documentation](/docs/4.x/javascript#the-snapshot-object).

### [#](#embedding-the-snapshot-in-the-html "Permalink")Embedding the snapshot in the HTML

When a component is first rendered, Livewire stores the snapshot as JSON inside an HTML attribute called `wire:snapshot`. This way, Livewire's JavaScript core can extract the JSON and turn it into a run-time object:

```
<div wire:id="..." wire:snapshot="{ state: {...}, memo: {...} }">

    Count: 1

 

    <button wire:click="increment">+</button>

</div>


```


## [#](#hydrating "Permalink")Hydrating

When a component update is triggered, for example, the "+" button is pressed in the `counter` component, a payload like the following is sent to the server:

```
{

    calls: [

        { method: 'increment', params: [] },

    ],

 

    snapshot: {

        state: {

            count: 1,

        },

 

        memo: {

            name: 'counter',

 

            id: '1526456',

        },

    }

}


```
Before Livewire can call the `increment` method, it must first create a new `counter` instance and seed it with the snapshot's state.

Here is some PHP pseudo-code that achieves this result:

```
$state = request('snapshot.state');

$memo = request('snapshot.memo');

 

$instance = Livewire::new($memo['name'], $memo['id']);

 

foreach ($state as $property => $value) {

    $instance[$property] = $value;

}


```
If you follow the above script, you will see that after creating a `counter` object, its public properties are set based on the state provided from the snapshot.

## [#](#advanced-hydration "Permalink")Advanced hydration

The above `counter` example works well to demonstrate the concept of hydration; however, it only demonstrates how Livewire handles hydrating simple values like integers (`1`).

As you may know, Livewire supports many more sophisticated property types beyond integers.

Let's take a look at a slightly more complex example - a `todos` component:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos;

 

    public function mount() {

        $this->todos = collect([

            'first',

            'second',

            'third',

        ]);

    }

};


```
As you can see, we are setting the `$todos` property to a [Laravel collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#main-content) with three strings as its content.

JSON alone has no way of representing Laravel collections, so instead, Livewire has created its own pattern of associating metadata with pure data inside a snapshot.

Here is the snapshot's state object for this `todos` component:

```
state: {

    todos: [

        [ 'first', 'second', 'third' ],

        { s: 'clctn', class: 'Illuminate\\Support\\Collection' },

    ],

},


```
This may be confusing to you if you were expecting something more straightforward like:

```
state: {

    todos: [ 'first', 'second', 'third' ],

},


```
However, if Livewire were hydrating a component based on this data, it would have no way of knowing it's a collection and not a plain array.

Therefore, Livewire supports an alternate state syntax in the form of a tuple (an array of two items):

```
todos: [

    [ 'first', 'second', 'third' ],

    { s: 'clctn', class: 'Illuminate\\Support\\Collection' },

],


```
When Livewire encounters a tuple when hydrating a component's state, it uses information stored in the second element of the tuple to more intelligently hydrate the state stored in the first.

To demonstrate more clearly, here is simplified code showing how Livewire might re-create a collection property based on the above snapshot:

```
[ $state, $metadata ] = request('snapshot.state.todos');

 

$collection = new $metadata['class']($state);


```
As you can see, Livewire uses the metadata associated with the state to derive the full collection class.

### [#](#deeply-nested-tuples "Permalink")Deeply nested tuples

One distinct advantage of this approach is the ability to dehydrate and hydrate deeply nested properties.

For example, consider the above `todos` example, except now with a [Laravel Stringable](https://laravel.com/docs/helpers#method-str) instead of a plain string as the third item in the collection:

```
<?php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $todos;

 

    public function mount() {

        $this->todos = collect([

            'first',

            'second',

            str('third'),

        ]);

    }

};


```
The dehydrated snapshot for this component's state would now look like this:

```
todos: [

    [

        'first',

        'second',

        [ 'third', { s: 'str' } ],

    ],

    { s: 'clctn', class: 'Illuminate\\Support\\Collection' },

],


```
As you can see, the third item in the collection has been dehydrated into a metadata tuple. The first element in the tuple being the plain string value, and the second being a flag denoting to Livewire that this string is a *stringable*.

### [#](#supporting-custom-property-types "Permalink")Supporting custom property types

Internally, Livewire has hydration support for the most common PHP and Laravel types. However, if you wish to support un-supported types, you can do so using [Synthesizers](/docs/4.x/synthesizers) — Livewire's internal mechanism for hydrating/dehydrating non-primitive property types.

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Like many other component-based frameworks, Livewire components are nestable — meaning one component can render multiple components within itself.

However, because Livewire's nesting system is built differently than other frameworks, there are certain implications and constraints that are important to be aware of.

Make sure you understand hydration first

Before learning more about Livewire's nesting system, it's helpful to fully understand how Livewire hydrates components. You can learn more by reading the [hydration documentation](/docs/4.x/hydration).

## [#](#every-component-is-independent-every-component-is-an-island "Permalink")Every component is independent {#every-component-is-an-island}

In Livewire, every component on a page tracks its state and makes updates independently of other components.

For example, consider the following `Posts` and nested `ShowPost` components:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class Posts extends Component

{

    public $postLimit = 2;

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.posts', [

            'posts' => Auth::user()->posts()

                ->limit($this->postLimit)->get(),

        ]);

    }

}


```

```
<div>

    Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">

 

    @foreach ($posts as $post)

        <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id">

    @endforeach

</div>


```

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public Post $post;

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.show-post');

    }

}


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

 

    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>

 

    <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh post</button>

</div>


```
Here's what the HTML for the entire component tree might look like on initial page load:

```
<div wire:id="123" wire:snapshot="...">

    Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">

 

    <div wire:id="456" wire:snapshot="...">

        <h1>The first post</h1>

 

        <p>Post content</p>

 

        <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh post</button>

    </div>

 

    <div wire:id="789" wire:snapshot="...">

        <h1>The second post</h1>

 

        <p>Post content</p>

 

        <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh post</button>

    </div>

</div>


```
Notice that the parent component contains both its rendered template and the rendered templates of all the components nested within it.

Because each component is independent, they each have their own IDs and snapshots (`wire:id` and `wire:snapshot`) embedded in their HTML for Livewire's JavaScript core to extract and track.

Let's consider a few different update scenarios to see the differences in how Livewire handles different levels of nesting.

### [#](#updating-a-child "Permalink")Updating a child

If you were to click the "Refresh post" button in one of the child `show-post` components, here is what would be sent to the server:

```
{

    memo: { name: 'show-post', id: '456' },

 

    state: { ... },

}


```
Here's the HTML that would get sent back:

```
<div wire:id="456">

    <h1>The first post</h1>

 

    <p>Post content</p>

 

    <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh post</button>

</div>


```
The important thing to note here is that when an update is triggered on a child component, only that component's data is sent to the server, and only that component is re-rendered.

Now let's look at the less intuitive scenario: updating a parent component.

### [#](#updating-the-parent "Permalink")Updating the parent

As a reminder, here's the Blade template of the parent `Posts` component:

```
<div>

    Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">

 

    @foreach ($posts as $post)

        <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id">

    @endforeach

</div>


```
If a user changes the "Post Limit" value from `2` to `1`, an update will be solely triggered on the parent.

Here's an example of what the request payload might look like:

```
{

    updates: { postLimit: 1 },

 

    snapshot: {

        memo: { name: 'posts', id: '123' },

 

        state: { postLimit: 2, ... },

    },

}


```
As you can see, only the snapshot for the parent `Posts` component is sent along to the server.

An important question you might be asking yourself is: what happens when the parent component re-renders and encounters the child `show-post` components? How will it re-render the children if their snapshots haven't been included in the request payload?

The answer is: they won't be re-rendered.

When Livewire renders the `Posts` component, it will render placeholders for any child components it encounters.

Here is an example of what the rendered HTML for the `Posts` component might be after the above update:

```
<div wire:id="123">

    Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">

 

    <div wire:id="456"></div>

</div>


```
As you can see, only one child has been rendered because `postLimit` was updated to `1`. However, you will also notice that instead of the full child component, there is only an empty `<div></div>` with the matching `wire:id` attribute.

When this HTML is received on the frontend, Livewire will *morph* the old HTML for this component into this new HTML, but intelligently skip any child component placeholders.

The effect is that, after *morphing*, the final DOM content of the parent `Posts` component will be the following:

```
<div wire:id="123">

    Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">

 

    <div wire:id="456">

        <h1>The first post</h1>

 

        <p>Post content</p>

 

        <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh post</button>

    </div>

</div>


```


## [#](#performance-implications "Permalink")Performance implications

Livewire's independent component architecture can have both positive and negative implications for your application.

An advantage of this architecture is it allows you to isolate expensive portions of your application. For example, you can quarantine a slow database query to its own independent component, and its performance overhead won't impact the rest of the page.

However, the biggest drawback of this approach is that because components are entirely separate, inter-component communication/dependencies becomes more difficult.

For example, if you had a property passed down from the above parent `Posts` component to the nested `ShowPost` component, it wouldn't be "reactive". Because each component is independent, if a request to the parent component changed the value of the property being passed into `ShowPost`, it wouldn't update inside `ShowPost`.

Livewire has overcome a number of these hurdles and provides dedicated APIs for these scenarios like: [Reactive properties](/docs/4.x/nesting#reactive-props), [Modelable components](/docs/4.x/nesting#binding-to-child-data-using-wiremodel), and [the `$parent` object](/docs/4.x/nesting#directly-accessing-the-parent-from-the-child).

Armed with this knowledge of how nested Livewire components operate, you will be able to make more informed decisions about when and how to nest components within your application.




# 0074_Troubleshooting

# Troubleshooting

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Here at Livewire HQ, we try to remove problems from your pathway before you hit them. However, sometimes, there are some problems that we can't solve without introducing new ones, and other times, there are problems we can't anticipate.

Here are some common errors and scenarios you may encounter in your Livewire apps.

## [#](#component-mismatches "Permalink")Component mismatches

When interacting with Livewire components on your page, you may encounter odd behavior or error messages like the following:

```
Error: Component already initialized


```

```
Error: Snapshot missing on Livewire component with id: ...


```
There are lots of reasons why you may encounter these messages, but the most common one is forgetting to add `wire:key` to elements and components inside a `@foreach` loop.

### [#](#adding-wirekey "Permalink")Adding `wire:key`

Any time you have a loop in your Blade templates using something like `@foreach`, you need to add `wire:key` to the opening tag of the first element within the loop:

```
@foreach($posts as $post)

    <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

        ...

    </div>

@endforeach


```
This ensures that Livewire can keep track of different elements in the loop when the loop changes.

The same applies to Livewire components within a loop:

```
@foreach($posts as $post)

    <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id" />

@endforeach


```
However, here's a tricky scenario you might not have assumed:

When you have a Livewire component deeply nested inside a `@foreach` loop, you STILL need to add a key to it. For example:

```
@foreach($posts as $post)

    <div wire:key="{{ $post->id }}">

        ...

        <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id" />

        ...

    </div>

@endforeach


```
Without the key on the nested Livewire component, Livewire will be unable to match the looped components up between network requests.

#### [#](#prefixing-keys "Permalink")Prefixing keys

Another tricky scenario you may run into is having duplicate keys within the same component. This often results from using model IDs as keys, which can sometimes collide.

Here's an example where we need to add a `post-` and an `author-` prefix to designate each set of keys as unique. Otherwise, if you have a `$post` and `$author` model with the same ID, you would have an ID collision:

```
<div>

    @foreach($posts as $post)

        <div wire:key="post-{{ $post->id }}">...</div>

    @endforeach

 

    @foreach($authors as $author)

        <div wire:key="author-{{ $author->id }}">...</div>

    @endforeach

</div>


```


## [#](#multiple-instances-of-alpine "Permalink")Multiple instances of Alpine

When installing Livewire, you may run into error messages like the following:

```
Error: Detected multiple instances of Alpine running


```

```
Alpine Expression Error: $wire is not defined


```
If this is the case, you likely have two versions of Alpine running on the same page. Livewire includes its own bundle of Alpine under the hood, so you must remove any other versions of Alpine on Livewire pages in your application.

One common scenario in which this happens is adding Livewire to an existing application that already includes Alpine. For example, if you installed the Laravel Breeze starter kit and then added Livewire later, you would run into this.

The fix for this is simple: remove the extra Alpine instance.

### [#](#removing-laravel-breezes-alpine "Permalink")Removing Laravel Breeze's Alpine

If you are installing Livewire inside an existing Laravel Breeze (Blade + Alpine version), you need to remove the following lines from `resources/js/app.js`:

```
 import './bootstrap';

  

-import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

- 

-window.Alpine = Alpine;

- 

-Alpine.start();


```


### [#](#removing-a-cdn-version-of-alpine "Permalink")Removing a CDN version of Alpine

Because Livewire version 2 and below didn't include Alpine by default, you may have included an Alpine CDN as a script tag in the head of your layout. In Livewire v3, you can remove this CDN altogether, and Livewire will automatically provide Alpine for you:

```
     ...

-    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

 </head>


```
Note: you can also remove any additional Alpine plugins, as Livewire includes all Alpine plugins except `@alpinejs/ui`.

## [#](#missing-alpinejsui "Permalink")Missing `@alpinejs/ui`

Livewire's bundled version of Alpine includes all Alpine plugins EXCEPT `@alpinejs/ui`. If you are using headless components from [Alpine Components](https://alpinejs.dev/components), which relies on this plugin, you may encounter errors like the following:

```
Uncaught Alpine: no element provided to x-anchor


```
To fix this, you can simply include the `@alpinejs/ui` plugin as a CDN in your layout file like so:

```
     ...

+    <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/@alpinejs/[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

 </head>


```
Note: be sure to include the latest version of this plugin, which you can find on [any component's documentation page](https://alpinejs.dev/component/headless-dialog/docs).




# 0075_Security

# Security

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

It's important to make sure your Livewire apps are secure and don't expose any application vulnerabilities. Livewire has internal security features to handle many cases, however, there are times when it's up to your application code to keep your components secure.

## [#](#authorizing-action-parameters "Permalink")Authorizing action parameters

Livewire actions are extremely powerful, however, any parameters passed to Livewire actions are mutable on the client and should be treated as un-trusted user input.

Arguably the most common security pitfall in Livewire is failing to validate and authorize Livewire action calls before persisting changes to the database.

Here is an example of an insecurity resulting from a lack of authorization:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    // ...

 

    public function delete($id)

    {

        // INSECURE!

 

        $post = Post::find($id);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

}


```

```
<button wire:click="delete({{ $post->id }})">Delete Post</button>


```
The reason the above example is insecure is that `wire:click="delete(...)"` can be modified in the browser to pass ANY post ID a malicious user wishes.

Action parameters (like `$id` in this case) should be treated the same as any untrusted input from the browser.

Therefore, to keep this application secure and prevent a user from deleting another user's post, we must add authorization to the `delete()` action.

First, let's create a [Laravel Policy](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) for the Post model by running the following command:

```
php artisan make:policy PostPolicy --model=Post


```
After running the above command, a new Policy will be created inside `app/Policies/PostPolicy.php`. We can then update its contents with a `delete` method like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Policies;

 

use App\Models\Post;

use App\Models\User;

 

class PostPolicy

{

    /**

     * Determine if the given post can be deleted by the user.

     */

    public function delete(?User $user, Post $post): bool

    {

        return $user?->id === $post->user_id;

    }

}


```
Now, we can use the `$this->authorize()` method from the Livewire component to ensure the user owns the post before deleting it:

```
public function delete($id)

{

    $post = Post::find($id);

 

    // If the user doesn't own the post,

    // an AuthorizationException will be thrown...

    $this->authorize('delete', $post);

 

    $post->delete();

}


```

- [Laravel Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies)


## [#](#authorizing-public-properties "Permalink")Authorizing public properties

Similar to action parameters, public properties in Livewire should be treated as un-trusted input from the user.

Here is the same example from above about deleting a post, written insecurely in a different manner:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public $postId;

 

    public function mount($postId)

    {

        $this->postId = $postId;

    }

 

    public function delete()

    {

        // INSECURE!

 

        $post = Post::find($this->postId);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

}


```

```
<button wire:click="delete">Delete Post</button>


```
As you can see, instead of passing the `$postId` as a parameter to the `delete` method from `wire:click`, we are storing it as a public property on the Livewire component.

The problem with this approach is that any malicious user can inject a custom element onto the page such as:

```
<input type="text" wire:model="postId">


```
This would allow them to freely modify the `$postId` before pressing "Delete Post". Because the `delete` action doesn't authorize the value of `$postId`, the user can now delete any post in the database, whether they own it or not.

To protect against this risk, there are two possible solutions:

### [#](#using-model-properties "Permalink")Using model properties

When setting public properties, Livewire treats models differently than plain values such as strings and integers. Because of this, if we instead store the entire post model as a property on the component, Livewire will ensure the ID is never tampered with.

Here is an example of storing a `$post` property instead of a simple `$postId` property:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount($postId)

    {

        $this->post = Post::find($postId);

    }

 

    public function delete()

    {

        $this->post->delete();

    }

}


```

```
<button wire:click="delete">Delete Post</button>


```
This component is now secured because there is no way for a malicious user to change the `$post` property to a different Eloquent model.

### [#](#locking-the-property "Permalink")Locking the property

Another way to prevent properties from being set to unwanted values is to use [the `#[Locked]` attribute](/docs/4.x/attribute-locked). Locking properties is done by applying the `#[Locked]` attribute. Now if users attempt to tamper with this value an error will be thrown.

Note that properties with the Locked attribute can still be changed in the back-end, so care still needs to taken that untrusted user input is not passed to the property in your own Livewire functions.

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Locked;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    #[Locked]

    public $postId;

 

    public function mount($postId)

    {

        $this->postId = $postId;

    }

 

    public function delete()

    {

        $post = Post::find($this->postId);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

}


```


### [#](#authorizing-the-property "Permalink")Authorizing the property

If using a model property is undesired in your scenario, you can of course fall-back to manually authorizing the deletion of the post inside the `delete` action:

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

 

class ShowPost extends Component

{

    public $postId;

 

    public function mount($postId)

    {

        $this->postId = $postId;

    }

 

    public function delete()

    {

        $post = Post::find($this->postId);

 

        $this->authorize('delete', $post);

 

        $post->delete();

    }

}


```

```
<button wire:click="delete">Delete Post</button>


```
Now, even though a malicious user can still freely modify the value of `$postId`, when the `delete` action is called, `$this->authorize()` will throw an `AuthorizationException` if the user does not own the post.

## [#](#middleware "Permalink")Middleware

When a Livewire component is loaded on a page containing route-level [Authorization Middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#via-middleware), like so:

```
Route::livewire('/post/{post}', App\Livewire\UpdatePost::class)

    ->middleware('can:update,post');


```
Livewire will ensure those middlewares are re-applied to subsequent Livewire network requests. This is referred to as "Persistent Middleware" in Livewire's core.

Persistent middleware protects you from scenarios where the authorization rules or user permissions have changed after the initial page-load.

Here's a more in-depth example of such a scenario:

```
Route::livewire('/post/{post}', App\Livewire\UpdatePost::class)

    ->middleware('can:update,post');


```

```
<?php

 

use App\Models\Post;

use Livewire\Component;

use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;

 

class UpdatePost extends Component

{

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Validate('required|min:5')]

    public $title = '';

 

    public $content = '';

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->title = $this->post->title;

        $this->content = $this->post->content;

    }

 

    public function update()

    {

        $this->post->update([

            'title' => $this->title,

            'content' => $this->content,

        ]);

    }

}


```
As you can see, the `can:update,post` middleware is applied at the route-level. This means that a user who doesn't have permission to update a post cannot view the page.

However, consider a scenario where a user:

- Loads the page
- Loses permission to update after the page loads
- Tries updating the post after losing permission


Because Livewire has already successfully loaded the page you might ask yourself: "When Livewire makes a subsequent request to update the post, will the `can:update,post` middleware be re-applied? Or instead, will the un-authorized user be able to update the post successfully?"

Because Livewire has internal mechanisms to re-apply middleware from the original endpoint, you are protected in this scenario.

### [#](#configuring-persistent-middleware "Permalink")Configuring persistent middleware

By default, Livewire persists the following middleware across network requests:

```
\Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,

\Laravel\Jetstream\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateSession::class,

\Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth::class,

\Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,

\App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,

\Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate::class,

\Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize::class,


```
If any of the above middlewares are applied to the initial page-load, they will be persisted (re-applied) to any future network requests.

However, if you are applying a custom middleware from your application on the initial page-load, and want it persisted between Livewire requests, you will need to add it to this list from a [Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers#main-content) in your app like so:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Providers;

 

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

use Livewire;

 

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider

{

    /**

     * Bootstrap any application services.

     */

    public function boot(): void

    {

        Livewire::addPersistentMiddleware([

            App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserHasRole::class,

        ]);

    }

}


```
If a Livewire component is loaded on a page that uses the `EnsureUserHasRole` middleware from your application, it will now be persisted and re-applied to any future network requests to that Livewire component.

Middleware arguments are not supported

Livewire currently doesn't support middleware arguments for persistent middleware definitions.

```
// Bad...

Livewire::addPersistentMiddleware(AuthorizeResource::class.':admin');

 

// Good...

Livewire::addPersistentMiddleware(AuthorizeResource::class);


```

### [#](#applying-global-livewire-middleware "Permalink")Applying global Livewire middleware

Alternatively, if you wish to apply specific middleware to every single Livewire update network request, you can do so by registering your own Livewire update route with any middleware you wish:

```
Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $path) {

    return Route::post($path, $handle)

        ->middleware(App\Http\Middleware\LocalizeViewPaths::class);

});


```
Any Livewire AJAX/fetch requests made to the server will use the above endpoint and apply the `LocalizeViewPaths` middleware before handling the component update.

Learn more about [customizing the update route on the Installation page](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/installation#configuring-livewires-update-endpoint).

## [#](#snapshot-checksums "Permalink")Snapshot checksums

Between every Livewire request, a snapshot is taken of the Livewire component and sent to the browser. This snapshot is used to re-build the component during the next server round-trip.

[Learn more about Livewire snapshots in the Hydration documentation.](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/hydration#the-snapshot)

Because fetch requests can be intercepted and tampered with in a browser, Livewire generates a "checksum" of each snapshot to go along with it.

This checksum is then used on the next network request to verify that the snapshot hasn't changed in any way.

If Livewire finds a checksum mismatch, it will throw a `CorruptComponentPayloadException` and the request will fail.

This protects against any form of malicious tampering that would otherwise result in granting users the ability to execute or modify unrelated code.




# 0076_CSP

# CSP

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

# CSP (Content Security Policy) Build

Livewire offers a CSP-safe build that allows you to use Livewire applications in environments with strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers that prohibit `'unsafe-eval'`.

## [#](#what-is-content-security-policy-csp "Permalink")What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and code injection attacks. CSP works by allowing web developers to control which resources the browser is allowed to load and execute.

One of the most restrictive CSP directives is `'unsafe-eval'`, which when omitted, prevents JavaScript from executing dynamic code through functions like `eval()`, `new Function()`, and similar constructs that compile and execute strings as code at runtime.

### [#](#why-csp-affects-livewire "Permalink")Why CSP Affects Livewire

By default, Livewire (and its underlying Alpine.js framework) uses `new Function()` declarations to compile and execute JavaScript expressions from HTML attributes like:

```
<button wire:click="$set('count', count + 1)">Increment</button>

<div wire:show="user.role === 'admin'">Admin panel</div>


```
While this approach is much faster and safer than using `eval()` directly, it still violates the `'unsafe-eval'` CSP directive that many security-conscious applications enforce.

## [#](#enabling-csp-safe-mode "Permalink")Enabling CSP-Safe Mode

To enable Livewire's CSP-safe mode, you need to modify your application's configuration:

### [#](#configuration "Permalink")Configuration

In your `config/livewire.php` file, set the `csp_safe` option to `true`:

```
'csp_safe' => true,


```


## [#](#impact-on-alpinejs "Permalink")Impact on Alpine.js

**Important**: When you enable CSP-safe mode in Livewire, it also affects all Alpine.js functionality in your application. Alpine will automatically use its CSP-safe evaluator, which means all Alpine expressions throughout your app will be subject to the same parsing limitations.

This is where most developers will notice the constraints, as Alpine expressions tend to be more complex than typical Livewire expressions.

## [#](#whats-supported "Permalink")What's Supported

The CSP build supports most common JavaScript expressions you'd use in Livewire:

### [#](#basic-livewire-expressions "Permalink")Basic Livewire Expressions

```
<!--  These work -->

<button wire:click="increment">+</button>

<button wire:click="decrement">-</button>

Some advanced JavaScript features won't work in CSP-safe mode:

### [#](#complex-javascript-expressions "Permalink")Complex JavaScript Expressions

```
<!-- L These don't work -->

```


### [#](#dynamic-property-access "Permalink")Dynamic Property Access

```
<!-- L These don't work -->

<div wire:show="user[dynamicProperty]">Bad</div>

<button wire:click="this[methodName]()">Bad</button>


```


## [#](#working-around-limitations "Permalink")Working around limitations

For complex Alpine expressions, use `Alpine.data()` or move logic to methods:

```
<!-- Instead of complex inline expressions -->

<div x-data="users">

    <div x-show="hasActiveAdmins">Admin panel available</div>

    <span x-text="activeUserCount">0</span>

</div>

 

<script nonce="[nonce]">

    Alpine.data('users', () => ({

        users: ...,

 

        get hasActiveAdmins() {

            return this.users.filter(u => u.active && u.role === 'admin').length > 0;

        },

 

        get activeUserCount() {

            return this.users.filter(u => u.active).length;

        }

    }));

</script>


```


## [#](#csp-headers-example "Permalink")CSP Headers Example

Here's an example of CSP headers that work with Livewire's CSP-safe build:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';

                        script-src 'nonce-[random]' 'strict-dynamic';

                        style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';


```
The key points:

- Remove `'unsafe-eval'` from your `script-src` directive
- Use nonce-based script loading with `'nonce-[random]'`
- Consider adding `'strict-dynamic'` for better compatibility with dynamically loaded scripts


## [#](#performance-considerations "Permalink")Performance Considerations

The CSP-safe build uses a different expression evaluator that:

- **Parsing**: Slightly slower initial parsing of expressions (usually negligible)
- **Runtime**: Similar runtime performance for simple expressions
- **Bundle size**: Slightly larger JavaScript bundle due to the custom parser


For most applications, these differences are imperceptible, but it's worth testing with your specific use case.

## [#](#testing-your-csp-implementation "Permalink")Testing Your CSP Implementation

To verify your CSP setup is working:

1. **Enable CSP headers** in your web server or application
2. **Test in browser dev tools** - CSP violations will appear in the console
3. **Verify expressions work** - All your Livewire and Alpine expressions should function normally
4. **Check for console errors** - No `unsafe-eval` violations should appear


## [#](#when-to-use-csp-safe-mode "Permalink")When to Use CSP-Safe Mode

Consider using CSP-safe mode when:

- Your application requires strict CSP compliance
- You're building applications for security-sensitive environments
- Your organization's security policies prohibit `'unsafe-eval'`
- You're deploying to platforms with mandatory CSP restrictions

## [#](#using-javascript-in-livewire-components "Permalink")Using JavaScript in Livewire components

Livewire and Alpine provide plenty of utilities for building dynamic components directly in your HTML, however, there are times when it's helpful to break out of the HTML and execute plain JavaScript for your component.

Class-based components need the @script directive

The examples on this page use bare `<script>` tags, which work for **single-file** and **multi-file** components. If you're using **class-based components** (where the Blade view is in a separate file from the PHP class), you must wrap your script tags with the `@script` directive:

```
@script

<script>

    // Your JavaScript here...

</script>

@endscript


```
This tells Livewire to handle the execution timing properly for class-based components.

### [#](#executing-scripts "Permalink")Executing scripts

You can add `<script>` tags directly inside your component template to execute JavaScript when the component loads.

Because these scripts are handled by Livewire, they execute at the perfect time—after the page has loaded, but before the Livewire component renders. This means you no longer need to wrap your scripts in `document.addEventListener('...')` to load them properly.

This also means that lazily or conditionally loaded Livewire components are still able to execute JavaScript after the page has initialized.

```
<div>

    ...

</div>

 

<script>

    // This Javascript will get executed every time this component is loaded onto the page...

</script>


```
Here's a more full example where you can do something like register a JavaScript action that is used in your Livewire component.

```
<div>

    <button wire:click="$js.increment">+</button>

</div>

 

<script>

    this.$js.increment = () => {

        console.log('increment')

    }

</script>


```
To learn more about JavaScript actions, [visit the actions documentation](/docs/4.x/actions#javascript-actions).

### [#](#using-wire-from-scripts "Permalink")Using `$wire` from scripts

When you add `<script>` tags inside your component, you automatically have access to your Livewire component's `$wire` object.

Here's an example of using a simple `setInterval` to refresh the component every 2 seconds (You could easily do this with [`wire:poll`](/docs/4.x/wire-poll), but it's a simple way to demonstrate the point):

```
<script>

    setInterval(() => {

        $wire.$refresh()

    }, 2000)

</script>


```


## [#](#the-wire-object "Permalink")The `$wire` object

The `$wire` object is your JavaScript interface to your Livewire component. It provides access to component properties, methods, and utilities for interacting with the server.

Inside component scripts, you can use `$wire` directly. Here are the most essential methods you'll use:

```
// Access and modify properties

$wire.count

$wire.count = 5

$wire.$set('count', 5)

 

// Call component methods

$wire.save()

$wire.delete(postId)

 

// Refresh the component

$wire.$refresh()

 

// Dispatch events

$wire.$dispatch('post-created', { postId: 2 })

 

// Listen for events

$wire.$on('post-created', (event) => {

    console.log(event.postId)

})

 

// Access the root element

$wire.$el.querySelector('.modal')


```


Complete $wire reference

For a comprehensive list of all `$wire` methods and properties, see the [$wire reference](#the-wire-object) at the bottom of this page.

## [#](#loading-assets "Permalink")Loading assets

Component `<script>` tags are useful for executing a bit of JavaScript every time a Livewire component loads, however, there are times you might want to load entire script and style assets on the page along with the component.

Here is an example of using `@assets` to load a date picker library called [Pikaday](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday) and initialize it inside your component:

```
<div>

    <input type="text" data-picker>

</div>

 

@assets

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pikaday/pikaday.js" defer></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pikaday/css/pikaday.css">

@endassets

 

<script>

    new Pikaday({ field: $wire.$el.querySelector('[data-picker]') });

</script>


```
When this component loads, Livewire will make sure any `@assets` are loaded on that page before evaluating scripts. In addition, it will ensure the provided `@assets` are only loaded once per page no matter how many instances of this component there are, unlike component scripts, which will evaluate for every component instance on the page.

## [#](#interceptors "Permalink")Interceptors

Intercept Livewire requests at three levels: **action** (most granular), **message** (per-component), and **request** (HTTP level).

```
// Action interceptors - fire for each action call

$wire.intercept(callback)                     // All actions on this component

$wire.intercept('save', callback)             // Only 'save' action

Livewire.interceptAction(callback)            // Global (all components)

 

// Message interceptors - fire for each component message

$wire.interceptMessage(callback)              // Messages from this component

$wire.interceptMessage('save', callback)      // Only when message contains 'save'

Livewire.interceptMessage(callback)           // Global (all components)

 

// Request interceptors - fire for each HTTP request

$wire.interceptRequest(callback)              // Requests involving this component

$wire.interceptRequest('save', callback)      // Only when request contains 'save'

Livewire.interceptRequest(callback)           // Global (all requests)


```
All interceptors return an unsubscribe function:

```
let unsubscribe = $wire.intercept(callback)

unsubscribe() // Remove the interceptor


```


### [#](#action-interceptors "Permalink")Action interceptors

Action interceptors are the most granular. They fire for each method call on a component.

```
$wire.intercept(({ action, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onFinish }) => {

    // action.name        - Method name ('save', '$refresh', etc.)

    // action.params      - Method parameters

    // action.component   - Component instance

    // action.cancel()    - Cancel this action

 

    onSend(({ call }) => {

        // call: { method, params, metadata }

    })

 

    onCancel(() => {})

 

    onSuccess((result) => {

        // result: Return value from PHP method

    })

 

    onError(({ response, body, preventDefault }) => {

        preventDefault() // Prevent error modal

    })

 

    onFailure(({ error }) => {

        // error: Network error

    })

 

    onFinish(() => {

        // Runs after DOM morph completes (or on error/cancel)

    })

})


```


### [#](#message-interceptors "Permalink")Message interceptors

Message interceptors fire for each component update. A message contains one or more actions.

```
$wire.interceptMessage(({ message, cancel, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onStream, onFinish }) => {

    // message.component  - Component instance

    // message.actions    - Set of actions in this message

    // cancel()           - Cancel this message

 

    onSend(({ payload }) => {

        // payload: { snapshot, updates, calls }

    })

 

    onCancel(() => {})

 

    onSuccess(({ payload, onSync, onEffect, onMorph, onRender }) => {

        // payload: { snapshot, effects }

 

        onSync(() => {})    // After state synced

        onEffect(() => {})  // After effects processed

        onMorph(async () => {})   // After DOM morphed (must be async)

        onRender(() => {})  // After render complete

    })

 

    onError(({ response, body, preventDefault }) => {

        preventDefault() // Prevent error modal

    })

 

    onFailure(({ error }) => {})

 

    onStream(({ json }) => {

        // json: Parsed stream chunk

    })

 

    onFinish(() => {

        // Runs after DOM morph completes (or on error/cancel)

    })

})


```


#### [#](#timing "Permalink")Timing

Hook execution order for successful requests:

1. `onSuccess` - Immediately after server response
2. `onSync` - After state merged
3. `onEffect` - After effects processed
4. `onMorph` - After DOM morphed
5. `onFinish` - After morph completes
6. `onRender` - In `requestAnimationFrame` (post-paint)


Action promises (`.then()`) resolve at the same time as `onFinish` (after morph).

### [#](#request-interceptors "Permalink")Request interceptors

Request interceptors fire for each HTTP request. A request may contain messages from multiple components.

```
$wire.interceptRequest(({ request, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onResponse, onParsed, onStream, onRedirect, onDump, onFinish }) => {

    // request.messages   - Set of messages in this request

    // request.cancel()   - Cancel this request

 

    onSend(({ responsePromise }) => {})

 

    onCancel(() => {})

 

    onResponse(({ response }) => {

        // response: Fetch Response (before body read)

    })

 

    onParsed(({ response, body }) => {

        // body: Response body as string

    })

 

    onSuccess(({ response, body, json }) => {})

 

    onError(({ response, body, preventDefault }) => {

        preventDefault() // Prevent error modal

    })

 

    onFailure(({ error }) => {})

 

    onStream(({ response }) => {})

 

    onRedirect(({ url, preventDefault }) => {

        preventDefault() // Prevent redirect

    })

 

    onDump(({ html, preventDefault }) => {

        preventDefault() // Prevent dump modal

    })

 

    onFinish(() => {})

})


```


### [#](#examples "Permalink")Examples

**Loading state for a component:**

```
<script>

    $wire.intercept(({ onSend, onFinish }) => {

        onSend(() => $wire.$el.classList.add('opacity-50'))

        onFinish(() => $wire.$el.classList.remove('opacity-50'))

    })

</script>


```
**Confirm before delete:**

```
<script>

    $wire.intercept('delete', ({ action }) => {

        if (!confirm('Are you sure?')) {

            action.cancel()

        }

    })

</script>


```
**Global session expiration handling:**

```
Livewire.interceptRequest(({ onError }) => {

    onError(({ response, preventDefault }) => {

        if (response.status === 419) {

            preventDefault()

            if (confirm('Session expired. Refresh?')) {

                window.location.reload()

            }

        }

    })

})


```
**Action-specific success notification:**

```
<script>

    $wire.intercept('save', ({ onSuccess, onError }) => {

        onSuccess(() => showToast('Saved!'))

        onError(() => showToast('Failed to save', 'error'))

    })

</script>


```


## [#](#global-livewire-events "Permalink")Global Livewire events

Livewire dispatches two helpful browser events for you to register any custom extension points from outside scripts:

```
<script>

    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {

        // Runs after Livewire is loaded but before it's initialized

        // on the page...

    })

 

    document.addEventListener('livewire:initialized', () => {

        // Runs immediately after Livewire has finished initializing

        // on the page...

    })

</script>


```


It is often beneficial to register any [custom directives](#registering-custom-directives) or [lifecycle hooks](#javascript-hooks) inside of `livewire:init` so that they are available before Livewire begins initializing on the page.

## [#](#the-livewire-global-object "Permalink")The `Livewire` global object

Livewire's global object is the best starting point for interacting with Livewire from external scripts.

You can access the global `Livewire` JavaScript object on `window` from anywhere inside your client-side code.

It is often helpful to use `window.Livewire` inside a `livewire:init` event listener

### [#](#accessing-components "Permalink")Accessing components

You can use the following methods to access specific Livewire components loaded on the current page:

```
// Retrieve the $wire object for the first component on the page...

let component = Livewire.first()

 

// Retrieve a given component's `$wire` object by its ID...

let component = Livewire.find(id)

 

// Retrieve an array of component `$wire` objects by name...

let components = Livewire.getByName(name)

 

// Retrieve $wire objects for every component on the page...

let components = Livewire.all()


```


Each of these methods returns a `$wire` object representing the component's state in Livewire.  

You can learn more about these objects in [the `$wire` documentation](#the-wire-object).

### [#](#interacting-with-events "Permalink")Interacting with events

In addition to dispatching and listening for events from individual components in PHP, the global `Livewire` object allows you to interact with [Livewire's event system](/docs/4.x/events) from anywhere in your application:

```
// Dispatch an event to any Livewire components listening...

Livewire.dispatch('post-created', { postId: 2 })

 

// Dispatch an event to a given Livewire component by name...

Livewire.dispatchTo('dashboard', 'post-created', { postId: 2 })

 

// Listen for events dispatched from Livewire components...

Livewire.on('post-created', ({ postId }) => {

    // ...

})


```
In certain scenarios, you might need to unregister global Livewire events. For instance, when working with Alpine components and `wire:navigate`, multiple listeners may be registered as `init` is called when navigating between pages. To address this, utilize the `destroy` function, automatically invoked by Alpine. Loop through all your listeners within this function to unregister them and prevent any unwanted accumulation.

```
Alpine.data('MyComponent', () => ({

    listeners: [],

    init() {

        this.listeners.push(

            Livewire.on('post-created', (options) => {

                // Do something...

            })

        );

    },

    destroy() {

        this.listeners.forEach((listener) => {

            listener();

        });

    }

}));


```


### [#](#using-lifecycle-hooks "Permalink")Using lifecycle hooks

Livewire allows you to hook into various parts of its global lifecycle using `Livewire.hook()`:

```
// Register a callback to execute on a given internal Livewire hook...

Livewire.hook('component.init', ({ component, cleanup }) => {

    // ...

})


```
More information about Livewire's JavaScript hooks can be [found below](#javascript-hooks).

### [#](#registering-custom-directives "Permalink")Registering custom directives

Livewire allows you to register custom directives using `Livewire.directive()`.

Below is an example of a custom `wire:confirm` directive that uses JavaScript's `confirm()` dialog to confirm or cancel an action before it is sent to the server:

```
<button wire:confirm="Are you sure?" wire:click="delete">Delete post</button>


```
Here is the implementation of `wire:confirm` using `Livewire.directive()`:

```
Livewire.directive('confirm', ({ el, directive, component, cleanup }) => {

    let content =  directive.expression

 

    // The "directive" object gives you access to the parsed directive.

    // For example, here are its values for: wire:click.prevent="deletePost(1)"

    //

    // directive.raw = wire:click.prevent

    // directive.value = "click"

    // directive.modifiers = ['prevent']

    // directive.expression = "deletePost(1)"

 

    let onClick = e => {

        if (! confirm(content)) {

            e.preventDefault()

            e.stopImmediatePropagation()

        }

    }

 

    el.addEventListener('click', onClick, { capture: true })

 

    // Register any cleanup code inside `cleanup()` in the case

    // where a Livewire component is removed from the DOM while

    // the page is still active.

    cleanup(() => {

        el.removeEventListener('click', onClick)

    })

})


```


## [#](#javascript-hooks "Permalink")JavaScript hooks

For advanced users, Livewire exposes its internal client-side "hook" system. You can use the following hooks to extend Livewire's functionality or gain more information about your Livewire application.

### [#](#component-initialization "Permalink")Component initialization

Every time a new component is discovered by Livewire — whether on the initial page load or later on — the `component.init` event is triggered. You can hook into `component.init` to intercept or initialize anything related to the new component:

```
Livewire.hook('component.init', ({ component, cleanup }) => {

    //

})


```
For more information, please consult the [documentation on the component object](#the-component-object).

### [#](#dom-element-initialization "Permalink")DOM element initialization

In addition to triggering an event when new components are initialized, Livewire triggers an event for each DOM element within a given Livewire component.

This can be used to provide custom Livewire HTML attributes within your application:

```
Livewire.hook('element.init', ({ component, el }) => {

    //

})


```


### [#](#dom-morph-hooks "Permalink")DOM Morph hooks

During the DOM morphing phase—which occurs after Livewire completes a network roundtrip—Livewire triggers a series of events for every element that is mutated.

```
Livewire.hook('morph.updating',  ({ el, component, toEl, skip, childrenOnly }) => {

    //

})

 

Livewire.hook('morph.updated', ({ el, component }) => {

    //

})

 

Livewire.hook('morph.removing', ({ el, component, skip }) => {

    //

})

 

Livewire.hook('morph.removed', ({ el, component }) => {

    //

})

 

Livewire.hook('morph.adding',  ({ el, component }) => {

    //

})

 

Livewire.hook('morph.added',  ({ el }) => {

    //

})


```
In addition to the events fired per element, a `morph` and `morphed` event is fired for each Livewire component:

```
Livewire.hook('morph',  ({ el, component }) => {

    // Runs just before the child elements in `component` are morphed (exluding partial morphing)

})

 

Livewire.hook('morphed',  ({ el, component }) => {

    // Runs after all child elements in `component` are morphed (excluding partial morphing)

})


```


## [#](#server-side-javascript-evaluation "Permalink")Server-side JavaScript evaluation

In addition to executing JavaScript directly in your components, you can use the `js()` method to evaluate JavaScript expressions from your server-side PHP code.

This is generally useful for performing some kind of client-side follow-up after a server-side action is performed.

For example, here is a `post.create` component that triggers a client-side alert dialog after the post is saved to the database:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $title = '';

 

    public function save()

    {

        // Save post to database...

 

        $this->js("alert('Post saved!')");

    }

};


```
The JavaScript expression `alert('Post saved!')` will be executed on the client after the post has been saved to the database on the server.

You can access the current component's `$wire` object inside the expression:

```
$this->js('$wire.$refresh()');

$this->js('$wire.$dispatch("post-created", { id: ' . $post->id . ' })');


```


## [#](#common-patterns "Permalink")Common patterns

Here are some common patterns for using JavaScript with Livewire in real-world applications.

### [#](#integrating-third-party-libraries "Permalink")Integrating third-party libraries

Many JavaScript libraries need to be initialized when elements are added to the page. Use component scripts to initialize libraries when your component loads:

```
<div>

    <div id="map" style="height: 400px;"></div>

</div>

 

@assets

<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY"></script>

@endassets

 

<script>

    new google.maps.Map($wire.$el.querySelector('#map'), {

        center: { lat: {{ $latitude }}, lng: {{ $longitude }} },

        zoom: 12

    });

</script>


```


### [#](#syncing-with-localstorage "Permalink")Syncing with localStorage

You can sync component state with localStorage using `$watch`:

```
<script>

    // Load from localStorage on init

    if (localStorage.getItem('draft')) {

        $wire.content = localStorage.getItem('draft');

    }

 

    // Save to localStorage when it changes

    $wire.$watch('content', (value) => {

        localStorage.setItem('draft', value);

    });

</script>


```


### [#](#using-the-js-directive "Permalink")Using the `@js` directive

If you need to output PHP data for use in JavaScript directly, you can use the `@js` directive.

```
<script>

    let posts = @js($posts)

 

    // "posts" will now be a JavaScript array of post data from PHP.

</script>


```


## [#](#best-practices "Permalink")Best practices

### [#](#component-scripts-vs-global-scripts "Permalink")Component scripts vs global scripts

**Use component scripts when:**

- The JavaScript is specific to that component's functionality
- You need access to `$wire` or component-specific data
- The code should run every time the component loads


**Use global scripts when:**

- Registering custom directives or hooks
- Setting up global event listeners
- Initializing app-wide JavaScript


### [#](#avoiding-memory-leaks "Permalink")Avoiding memory leaks

When adding event listeners in component scripts, Livewire automatically cleans them up when the component is removed. However, if you're using global interceptors or hooks, make sure to clean up when appropriate:

```
// Component-level - automatically cleaned up ✓

$wire.intercept(({ onSend }) => {

    onSend(() => console.log('Sending...'));

});

 

// Global-level - lives for the entire page lifecycle

Livewire.interceptMessage(({ onSend }) => {

    onSend(() => console.log('Sending...'));

});


```


### [#](#debugging-tips "Permalink")Debugging tips

**Access component from browser console:**

```
// Get first component on page

let $wire = Livewire.first()

 

// Inspect component state

console.log($wire.count)

 

// Call methods

$wire.increment()


```
**Monitor all requests:**

```
Livewire.interceptRequest(({ onSend }) => {

    onSend(() => {

        console.log('Request sent:', Date.now());

    });

});


```
**View component snapshots:**

```
let component = Livewire.first().__instance()

console.log(component.snapshot)


```


### [#](#performance-considerations "Permalink")Performance considerations

- Use `wire:ignore` on elements that shouldn't be touched by Livewire's DOM morphing
- Debounce expensive operations using `wire:model.debounce` or JavaScript debouncing
- Use lazy loading (`lazy` parameter) for components that aren't immediately visible
- Consider using islands for isolated regions that update independently

## [#](#reference "Permalink")Reference

When extending Livewire's JavaScript system, it's important to understand the different objects you might encounter.

Here is an exhaustive reference of each of Livewire's relevant internal properties.

As a reminder, the average Livewire user may never interact with these. Most of these objects are available for Livewire's internal system or advanced users.

### [#](#the-wire-object-1 "Permalink")The `$wire` object

Given the following generic `Counter` component:

```
<?php

 

namespace App\Livewire;

 

use Livewire\Component;

 

class Counter extends Component

{

    public $count = 1;

 

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++;

    }

 

    public function render()

    {

        return view('livewire.counter');

    }

}


```
Livewire exposes a JavaScript representation of the server-side component in the form of an object that is commonly referred to as `$wire`:

```
let $wire = {

    // All component public properties are directly accessible on $wire...

    count: 0,

 

    // All public methods are exposed and callable on $wire...

    increment() { ... },

 

    // Access the `$wire` object of the parent component if one exists...

    $parent,

 

    // Access the root DOM element of the Livewire component...

    $el,

 

    // Access the ID of the current Livewire component...

    $id,

 

    // Get the value of a property by name...

    // Usage: $wire.$get('count')

    $get(name) { ... },

 

    // Set a property on the component by name...

    // Usage: $wire.$set('count', 5)

    $set(name, value, live = true) { ... },

 

    // Toggle the value of a boolean property...

    $toggle(name, live = true) { ... },

 

    // Call the method...

    // Usage: $wire.$call('increment')

    $call(method, ...params) { ... },

 

    // Define a JavaScript action...

    // Usage: $wire.$js('increment', () => { ... })

    // Usage: $wire.$js.increment = () => { ... }

    $js(name, callback) { ... },

 

    // [DEPRECATED] Entangle - You probably don't need this.

    // Use $wire directly to access properties instead.

    // Usage: <div x-data="{ count: $wire.$entangle('count') }">

    $entangle(name, live = false) { ... },

 

    // Watch the value of a property for changes...

    // Usage: Alpine.$watch('count', (value, old) => { ... })

    $watch(name, callback) { ... },

 

    // Scope the next action to a named island...

    // Returns $wire so you can chain any method call.

    // The chained action will only re-render the named island.

    // Usage: $wire.$island('revenue').$refresh()

    // Usage: $wire.$island('feed', { mode: 'append' }).loadMore()

    $island(name, options = {}) { ... },

 

    // Refresh a component by sending a message to the server

    // to re-render the HTML and swap it into the page...

    $refresh() { ... },

 

    // Identical to the above `$refresh`. Just a more technical name...

    $commit() { ... }, // Alias for $refresh()

 

    // Listen for a an event dispatched from this component or its children...

    // Usage: $wire.$on('post-created', () => { ... })

    $on(event, callback) { ... },

 

    // Listen for a lifecycle hook triggered from this component or the request...

    // Usage: $wire.$hook('message.sent', () => { ... })

    $hook(name, callback) { ... },

 

    // Dispatch an event from this component...

    // Usage: $wire.$dispatch('post-created', { postId: 2 })

    $dispatch(event, params = {}) { ... },

 

    // Dispatch an event onto another component...

    // Usage: $wire.$dispatchTo('dashboard', 'post-created', { postId: 2 })

    $dispatchTo(otherComponentName, event, params = {}) { ... },

 

    // Dispatch an event onto this component and no others...

    $dispatchSelf(event, params = {}) { ... },

 

    // A JS API to upload a file directly to component

    // rather than through `wire:model`...

    $upload(

        name, // The property name

        file, // The File JavaScript object

        finish = () => { ... }, // Runs when the upload is finished...

        error = () => { ... }, // Runs if an error is triggered mid-upload...

        progress = (event) => { // Runs as the upload progresses...

            event.detail.progress // An integer from 1-100...

        },

    ) { ... },

 

    // API to upload multiple files at the same time...

    $uploadMultiple(name, files, finish, error, progress) { },

 

    // Remove an upload after it's been temporarily uploaded but not saved...

    $removeUpload(name, tmpFilename, finish, error) { ... },

 

    // Register an action interceptor for this component instance

    // Usage: $wire.intercept(({ action, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onFinish }) => { ... })

    // Or scope to specific action: $wire.intercept('save', ({ action, onSuccess }) => { ... })

    intercept(actionOrCallback, callback) { ... },

 

    // Alias for intercept

    interceptAction(actionOrCallback, callback) { ... },

 

    // Register a message interceptor for this component instance

    // Usage: $wire.interceptMessage(({ message, cancel, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onFinish }) => { ... })

    // Or scope to specific action: $wire.interceptMessage('save', callback)

    interceptMessage(actionOrCallback, callback) { ... },

 

    // Register a request interceptor for this component instance

    // Usage: $wire.interceptRequest(({ request, onSend, onCancel, onSuccess, onError, onFailure, onFinish }) => { ... })

    // Or scope to specific action: $wire.interceptRequest('save', callback)

    interceptRequest(actionOrCallback, callback) { ... },

 

    // Retrieve the underlying "component" object...

    __instance() { ... },

}


```
You can learn more about `$wire` in [Livewire's documentation on accessing properties in JavaScript](/docs/4.x/properties#accessing-properties-from-javascript).

### [#](#the-snapshot-object "Permalink")The `snapshot` object

Between each network request, Livewire serializes the PHP component into an object that can be consumed in JavaScript. This snapshot is used to unserialize the component back into a PHP object and therefore has mechanisms built in to prevent tampering:

```
let snapshot = {

    // The serialized state of the component (public properties)...

    data: { count: 0 },

 

    // Long-standing information about the component...

    memo: {

        // The component's unique ID...

        id: '0qCY3ri9pzSSMIXPGg8F',

 

        // The component's name. Ex. <livewire:[name] />

        name: 'counter',

 

        // The URI, method, and locale of the web page that the

        // component was originally loaded on. This is used

        // to re-apply any middleware from the original request

        // to subsequent component update requests (messages)...

        path: '/',

        method: 'GET',

        locale: 'en',

 

        // A list of any nested "child" components. Keyed by

        // internal template ID with the component ID as the values...

        children: [],

 

        // Whether or not this component was "lazy loaded"...

        lazyLoaded: false,

 

        // A list of any validation errors thrown during the

        // last request...

        errors: [],

    },

 

    // A securely encrypted hash of this snapshot. This way,

    // if a malicious user tampers with the snapshot with

    // the goal of accessing un-owned resources on the server,

    // the checksum validation will fail and an error will

    // be thrown...

    checksum: '1bc274eea17a434e33d26bcaba4a247a4a7768bd286456a83ea6e9be2d18c1e7',

}


```


### [#](#the-component-object "Permalink")The `component` object

Every component on a page has a corresponding component object behind the scenes keeping track of its state and exposing its underlying functionality. This is one layer deeper than `$wire`. It is only meant for advanced usage.

Here's an actual component object for the above `Counter` component with descriptions of relevant properties in JS comments:

```
let component = {

    // The root HTML element of the component...

    el: HTMLElement,

 

    // The unique ID of the component...

    id: '0qCY3ri9pzSSMIXPGg8F',

 

    // The component's "name" (<livewire:[name] />)...

    name: 'counter',

 

    // The latest "effects" object. Effects are "side-effects" from server

    // round-trips. These include redirects, file downloads, etc...

    effects: {},

 

    // The component's last-known server-side state...

    canonical: { count: 0 },

 

    // The component's mutable data object representing its

    // live client-side state...

    ephemeral: { count: 0 },

 

    // A reactive version of `this.ephemeral`. Changes to

    // this object will be picked up by AlpineJS expressions...

    reactive: Proxy,

 

    // A Proxy object that is typically used inside Alpine

    // expressions as `$wire`. This is meant to provide a

    // friendly JS object interface for Livewire components...

    $wire: Proxy,

 

    // A list of any nested "child" components. Keyed by

    // internal template ID with the component ID as the values...

    children: [],

 

    // The last-known "snapshot" representation of this component.

    // Snapshots are taken from the server-side component and used

    // to re-create the PHP object on the backend...

    snapshot: {...},

 

    // The un-parsed version of the above snapshot. This is used to send back to the

    // server on the next roundtrip because JS parsing messes with PHP encoding

    // which often results in checksum mis-matches.

    snapshotEncoded: '{"data":{"count":0},"memo":{"id":"0qCY3ri9pzSSMIXPGg8F","name":"counter","path":"\/","method":"GET","children":[],"lazyLoaded":true,"errors":[],"locale":"en"},"checksum":"1bc274eea17a434e33d26bcaba4a247a4a7768bd286456a83ea6e9be2d18c1e7"}',

}


```


### [#](#the-message-payload "Permalink")The `message` payload

When an action is performed on a Livewire component in the browser, a network request is triggered. That network request contains one or many components and various instructions for the server. Internally, these component network payloads are called "messages".

A "message" represents the data sent from the frontend to the backend when a component needs to update. A component is rendered and manipulated on the frontend until an action is performed that requires it to send a message with its state and updates to the backend.

You will recognize this schema from the payload in the network tab of your browser's DevTools, or [Livewire's JavaScript hooks](#javascript-hooks):

```
let message = {

    // Snapshot object...

    snapshot: { ... },

 

    // A key-value pair list of properties

    // to update on the server...

    updates: {},

 

    // An array of methods (with parameters) to call server-side...

    calls: [

        { method: 'increment', params: [] },

    ],

}


```




# 0078_Synthesizers

# Synthesizers

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Because Livewire components are dehydrated (serialized) into JSON, then hydrated (unserialized) back into PHP components between requests, their properties need to be JSON-serializable.

Natively, PHP serializes most primitive values into JSON easily. However, in order for Livewire components to support more sophisticated property types (like models, collections, carbon instances, and stringables), a more robust system is needed.

Therefore, Livewire provides a point of extension called "Synthesizers" that allow users to support any custom property types they wish.

Make sure you understand hydration first

Before using Synthesizers, it's helpful to fully understand Livewire's hydration system. You can learn more by reading the [hydration documentation](/docs/4.x/hydration).

## [#](#understanding-synthesizers "Permalink")Understanding Synthesizers

Before exploring the creation of custom Synthesizers, let's first look at the internal Synthesizer that Livewire uses to support [Laravel Stringables](https://laravel.com/docs/strings).

Suppose your application contained the following `CreatePost` component:

```
class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

}


```
Between requests, Livewire might serialize this component's state into a JSON object like the following:

```
state: { title: '' },


```
Now, consider a more advanced example where the `$title` property value is a stringable instead of a plain string:

```
class CreatePost extends Component

{

    public $title = '';

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->title = str($this->title);

    }

}


```
The dehydrated JSON representing this component's state now contains a [metadata tuple](/docs/4.x/hydration#deeply-nested-tuples) instead of a plain empty string:

```
state: { title: ['', { s: 'str' }] },


```
Livewire can now use this tuple to hydrate the `$title` property back into a stringable on the next request.

Now that you've seen the outside-in effects of Synthesizers, here is the actual source code for Livewire's internal stringable synth:

```
use Illuminate\Support\Stringable;

 

class StringableSynth extends Synth

{

    public static $key = 'str';

 

    public static function match($target)

    {

        return $target instanceof Stringable;

    }

 

    public function dehydrate($target)

    {

        return [$target->__toString(), []];

    }

 

    public function hydrate($value)

    {

        return str($value);

    }

}


```
Let's break this down piece by piece.

First is the `$key` property:

```
public static $key = 'str';


```
Every synth must contain a static `$key` property that Livewire uses to convert a [metadata tuple](/docs/4.x/hydration#deeply-nested-tuples) like `['', { s: 'str' }]` back into a stringable. As you may notice, each metadata tuple has an `s` key referencing this key.

Inversely, when Livewire is dehydrating a property, it will use the synth's static `match()` function to identify if this particular Synthesizer is a good candidate to dehydrate the current property (`$target` being the current value of the property):

```
public static function match($target)

{

    return $target instanceof Stringable;

}


```
If `match()` returns true, the `dehydrate()` method will be used to take the property's PHP value as input and return the JSONable [metadata](/docs/4.x/hydration#deeply-nested-tuples) tuple:

```
public function dehydrate($target)

{

    return [$target->__toString(), []];

}


```
Now, at the beginning of the next request, after this Synthesizer has been matched by the `{ s: 'str' }` key in the tuple, the `hydrate()` method will be called and passed the raw JSON representation of the property with the expectation that it returns the full PHP-compatible value to be assigned to the property.

```
public function hydrate($value)

{

    return str($value);

}


```


## [#](#registering-a-custom-synthesizer "Permalink")Registering a custom Synthesizer

To demonstrate how you might author your own Synthesizer to support a custom property, we will use the following `UpdateProperty` component as an example:

```
class UpdateProperty extends Component

{

    public Address $address;

 

    public function mount()

    {

        $this->address = new Address();

    }

}


```
Here's the source for the `Address` class:

```
namespace App\Dtos\Address;

 

class Address

{

    public $street = '';

    public $city = '';

    public $state = '';

    public $zip = '';

}


```
To support properties of type `Address`, we can use the following Synthesizer:

```
use App\Dtos\Address;

 

class AddressSynth extends Synth

{

    public static $key = 'address';

 

    public static function match($target)

    {

        return $target instanceof Address;

    }

 

    public function dehydrate($target)

    {

        return [[

            'street' => $target->street,

            'city' => $target->city,

            'state' => $target->state,

            'zip' => $target->zip,

        ], []];

    }

 

    public function hydrate($value)

    {

        $instance = new Address;

 

        $instance->street = $value['street'];

        $instance->city = $value['city'];

        $instance->state = $value['state'];

        $instance->zip = $value['zip'];

 

        return $instance;

    }

}


```
To make it available globally in your application, you can use Livewire's `propertySynthesizer` method to register the synthesizer from your service provider boot method:

```
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider

{

    /**

     * Bootstrap any application services.

     */

    public function boot(): void

    {

        Livewire::propertySynthesizer(AddressSynth::class);

    }

}


```


## [#](#supporting-data-binding "Permalink")Supporting data binding

Using the `UpdateProperty` example from above, it is likely that you would want to support `wire:model` binding directly to properties of the `Address` object. Synthesizers allow you to support this using the `get()` and `set()` methods:

```
use App\Dtos\Address;

 

class AddressSynth extends Synth

{

    public static $key = 'address';

 

    public static function match($target)

    {

        return $target instanceof Address;

    }

 

    public function dehydrate($target)

    {

        return [[

            'street' => $target->street,

            'city' => $target->city,

            'state' => $target->state,

            'zip' => $target->zip,

        ], []];

    }

 

    public function hydrate($value)

    {

        $instance = new Address;

 

        $instance->street = $value['street'];

        $instance->city = $value['city'];

        $instance->state = $value['state'];

        $instance->zip = $value['zip'];

 

        return $instance;

    }

 

    public function get(&$target, $key)

    {

        return $target->{$key};

    }

 

    public function set(&$target, $key, $value)

    {

        $target->{$key} = $value;

    }

}


```




# 0079_Package Development

# Package Development

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

To include Livewire components in a Laravel package, you'll need to register them in your package's service provider.

## [#](#single-file-and-multi-file-components "Permalink")Single-file and multi-file components

For single-file (SFC) and multi-file (MFC) components, use `addNamespace` in your service provider's `boot()` method:

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

public function boot(): void

{

    Livewire::addNamespace(

        namespace: 'mypackage',

        viewPath: __DIR__ . '/../resources/views/livewire',

    );

}


```
This registers all SFC and MFC components in your package's `resources/views/livewire` directory under the `mypackage` namespace.

**Usage:**

```
<livewire:mypackage::counter />

<livewire:mypackage::users.table />


```


## [#](#class-based-components "Permalink")Class-based components

For class-based components, you'll need to provide additional parameters and register your views with Laravel:

```
use Livewire\Livewire;

 

public function boot(): void

{

    Livewire::addNamespace(

        namespace: 'mypackage',

        classNamespace: 'MyVendor\\MyPackage\\Livewire',

        classPath: __DIR__ . '/Livewire',

        classViewPath: __DIR__ . '/../resources/views/livewire',

    );

 

    $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__ . '/../resources/views', 'my-package');

}


```
Your component's `render()` method should reference the view using Laravel's package namespace syntax:

```
public function render()

{

    return view('my-package::livewire.counter');

}


```
**Usage:**

```
<livewire:mypackage::counter />


```


## [#](#file-naming "Permalink")File naming

The ⚡ emoji prefix used in Livewire component filenames can cause issues with Composer when publishing packages. For package development, avoid using the bolt emoji in your component filenames—use `counter.blade.php` instead of `⚡counter.blade.php`.




# 0080_Contribution Guide

# Contribution Guide

New Laracasts series

Master everything new in Livewire v4

[Start learning](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4)

Hi there and welcome to the Livewire contribution guide. In this guide, we are going to take a look at how you can contribute to Livewire by submitting new features, fixing failing tests, or resolving bugs.

## [#](#setting-up-livewire-and-alpine-locally "Permalink")Setting up Livewire and Alpine locally

To contribute, the easiest way is to ensure that the Livewire and Alpine repositories are set up on your local machine. This will allow you to make changes and run the test suite with ease.

### [#](#forking-and-cloning-the-repositories "Permalink")Forking and cloning the repositories

To get started, the first step is to fork and clone the repositories. The easiest way to do this is by using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), but you can also perform these steps manually by clicking the "Fork" button on the GitHub [repository page](https://github.com/livewire/livewire).

```
# Fork and clone Livewire

gh repo fork livewire/livewire --default-branch-only --clone=true --remote=false -- livewire

 

# Switch the working directory to livewire

cd livewire

 

# Install all composer dependencies

composer install

 

# Ensure Dusk is correctly configured

vendor/bin/dusk-updater detect --no-interaction


```
To set up Alpine, make sure you have [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed, and then run the following commands. If you prefer to fork manually, you can visit the [repository page](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).

```
# Fork and clone Alpine

gh repo fork alpinejs/alpine --default-branch-only --clone=true --remote=false -- alpine

 

# Switch the working directory to alpine

cd alpine

 

# Install all npm dependencies

npm install

 

# Build all Alpine packages

npm run build

 

# Link all Alpine packages locally

## [#](#contributing-a-failing-test "Permalink")Contributing a Failing Test

If you're encountering a bug and are unsure about how to solve it, especially given the complexity of the Livewire core, you might be wondering where to start. In such cases, the easiest approach is to contribute a failing test. This way, someone with more experience can assist in identifying and fixing the bug. Nonetheless, we do recommend that you also explore the core to gain a better understanding of how Livewire operates.

Let's take a step-by-step approach.

#### [#](#1-determine-where-to-add-your-test "Permalink")1. Determine where to add your test

The Livewire core is divided into different folders, each corresponding to specific Livewire features. For example:

```
src/Features/SupportAccessingParent

src/Features/SupportAttributes

src/Features/SupportAutoInjectedAssets

src/Features/SupportBladeAttributes

src/Features/SupportChecksumErrorDebugging

src/Features/SupportComputed

src/Features/SupportConsoleCommands

src/Features/SupportDataBinding

//...


```
Try to locate a feature that is related to the bug you are experiencing. If you can't find an appropriate folder or if you're unsure about which one to select, you can simply choose one and mention in your pull request that you require assistance with placing the test in the correct feature set.

#### [#](#2-determine-the-type-of-test "Permalink")2. Determine the type of test

The Livewire test suite consists of two types of tests:

1. **Unit tests**: These tests focus on the PHP implementation of Livewire.
2. **Browser tests**: These tests run a series of steps inside a real browser and assert the correct outcome. They mainly focus on the Javascript implementation of Livewire.


If you're unsure about which type of test to choose or if you're unfamiliar with writing tests for Livewire, you can start with a browser test. Implement the steps you perform in your application and browser to reproduce the bug.

Unit tests should be added to the `UnitTest.php` file, and browser tests should be added to `BrowserTest.php`. If one or both of these files do not exist, you can create them yourself.

**Unit test**

```
use Tests\TestCase;

 

class UnitTest extends TestCase

{

    public function test_livewire_can_run_action(): void

    {

       // ...

    }

}


```
**Browser test**

```
use Tests\BrowserTestCase;

 

class BrowserTest extends BrowserTestCase

{

    public function test_livewire_can_run_action()

    {

        // ...

    }

}


```


Not sure how to write tests?

You can learn a lot by explore existing Unit and Browser tests to learn how tests are written. Even copying and pasting an existing test is a great starting point for writing your own test.

#### [#](#3-running-the-tests "Permalink")3. Running the tests

Before submitting your pull request, make sure your test passes. You can do so by running one of the following commands:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter "test_can_make_method_a_computed" # To run a specific test

vendor/bin/phpunit # To run all tests


```
By default, browser tests will run in headed mode. If you want to run them in headless mode, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the Livewire repository and add `DUSK_HEADLESS_DISABLED=false`.

#### [#](#4-preparing-your-pull-request-branch "Permalink")4. Preparing your pull request branch

Once you have completed your feature or failing test, it's time to submit your Pull Request (PR) to the Livewire repository. First, ensure that you commit your changes to a separate branch (avoid using `main`). To create a new branch, you can use the `git` command:

```
git checkout -b my-feature


```
You can name your branch anything you want, but for future reference, it's helpful to use a descriptive name that reflects your feature or failing test.

Next, commit your changes to your branch. You can use `git add .` to stage all changes and then `git commit -m "Add my feature"` to commit all changes with a descriptive commit message.

However, your branch is currently only available on your local machine. To create a Pull Request, you need to push your branch to your forked Livewire repository using `git push`.

```
git push origin my-feature
